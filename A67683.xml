            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>WHen in my <hi>Exceptions</hi> I diſcourſed ſo largely againſt the <hi>Theory of the Earth,</hi> I did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ingage with it again; nor ſhould I have done it but for very good Reaſons; the principal of which are theſe four.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To vindicate GOD's Veracity. To the doing of which, by ſpeaking, or writing, upon juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſions or accounts; I Take my very <hi>having</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:51858:3"/> of a Tongue and Hand, to be ſufficient Obligations. And truly, what is more fit, and what <hi>can</hi> be more needful, than to vindicate this Attribute (one of the chief of GOD's <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or Divine Properties) and aſſert the Perfection and Inviolableneſs of it? For upon it depends no leſs than our future Welfare, or everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs. Take away this Veracity, and the Goſpel (according to Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Tenths expreſſion) is but <hi>Fabula Chriſti,</hi> a piece of meer Forgery. And ſhould Scripture be Fabulous, where's our ſecutity for a better Life? Then our Faith is vain, and our Hope without foundation, and we can lay no claim to the high Felicities of the Eternal World. And yet, if <hi>all</hi> that the Great GOD has ſaid, be not firm and true, in every punctilio or <hi>tittle</hi> of it, this Veracity of His is not Inviolable; and ſo, what have Mankind left them to truſt to? For ſhould GOD deceive them in <hi>one</hi> caſe, he might do it in <hi>more;</hi> and if he does it in <hi>many,</hi> he may do it in <hi>all:</hi> and then, what ſhall ſupport them as to their nobleſt Intereſts? The firſt reaſon, therefore, of this ſecond ſally of my Pen here, is farther to defend the <hi>truth</hi> of GOD, and to reſcue ſome Texts of the Holy Bible from ſuch imputations of falſhood, as the Doctrine of the Theory involves them in. And indeed, if ſuch imputations could be juſtly faſtned upon any <hi>part</hi> of the inſpired Volume, they would bid fair to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards cancelling the <hi>whole.</hi> Do we not plainly ſee, that if one ſingle link breaks or drops off, the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of the Chain is quite diſſolved? So if the leaſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle paſſage of GOD's Word be falſe, it certainly ſhews the reſt to be fallible; and a failure of truth in any <hi>one</hi> of its periods, overthrows the credibility of <hi>all</hi> the other. And then, in ſhort, we have neither proofs, nor hopes, nor any manner of aſſurance of bleſſed Immortality; that unſpeakably excellent and glorious thing, to which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51858:3"/> we all <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>ſhould</hi> aſpire. Our title to <hi>that</hi> is for ever blaſted, becauſe then the authentick Charter which contains it, proves counterſeit Evidence, and a ſpecious Nullity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To maintain the honour of <hi>Moſes.</hi> Who, if he had not been dignify'd with the high Privilege of Divine Inſpiration, ought upon his <hi>own</hi> account, to have been <hi>above</hi> all ſuſpicion of fiction or falſhood. And to charge him with either, tho but indirectly, and even in his naked Perſonal capacity, muſt ſeem too inſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a diminution or diſparagement of his Greatneſs and Worthineſs. For according to <hi>Philo,</hi> as in his Offices he was <hi>high;</hi> being<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <hi>not taking up with things probable, or credible, but following after ſincere,</hi> or exacteſt <hi>verity.</hi> Yet this moſt excellent and admirable Author, as he was ſufficiently <hi>diſregarded</hi> by the Theoriſt before; ſo by his defending his <hi>Anti-Moſaic</hi> aſſertions, he is little leſs than deſpiſed now. For by making ſome Paſſages in his famous <hi>Coſmopoeia,</hi> untrue; he degrades it into the rank of meer fabulous or conjectural Writings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To pay reſpect to the Anſwerer. Who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving favour'd me above others, with an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> as he calls it, to my <hi>Exceptions;</hi> I had no reaſon, I thought, to be behind hand with him in Civility of the like Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To defend and right my ſelf. For beſides ſuch blows as are proper, and becoming an Antagoniſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51858:4"/> to give; and ſo ought to be born, or returned with Fairneſs; I am very ſenſible, that in this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> ſeveral Attaques are made upon me, from another force than that of Reaſon and Philoſophy; and according to other meaſures, than thoſe of Learning and Ingenuity. And truly in repelling theſe, my ſtile might well have been very cutting, conſidering what the Anſwerer has done to whet it. But as Truth may be defended without Railery; ſo I underſtand not the Wiſdom of mens ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Pens, to ſcratch one another with them till the blood comes, meerly to make the By-ſtanders ſport. Yet he having been pleas'd to throw Dirt upon me, he muſt give me leave to bruſh it off again; and if any of it chances to fly in his Eyes, he may thank himſelf for it.</p>
               <p>I thought I had had to with a genteel <hi>Platoniſt,</hi> and a Perſon above all Cynical Reflections. But he having made them in ſo great Plenty, I can do no leſs than take notice of ſome of them.</p>
               <p>In a word; as the Anſwerer has thought fit to ſpeak <hi>freely,</hi> ſo the Replicant is forc'd to ſpeak <hi>plainly.</hi> For ſome he perceives, cannot, or will not hear, unleſs men ſhout or hallow to them; and to be mealy-mouth'd is a great fault, where to ſpeak out is abſolutely neceſſary. And neceſſary it is, where the cauſe will bear it, and the Truth requires it.</p>
               <p>But before we enter upon our Work, it muſt be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by the way; that to facilitate his Anſwer, our Author makes uſe of <hi>Two</hi> pretty odd and inallowable <hi>Expedients.</hi> As</p>
               <p>Firſt, he betakes himſelf too often to <hi>Extraordinary Providence.</hi> Where he is brought to Straits, and (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſuperable) Difficulties; he runs directly to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providence,</hi> to free him from the ſame. And as if that were to patronize his extravagant Phantaſies,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51858:4"/> he makes it a common Refuge for them. He readily aſcribes ſtrange Phaenomenaes to it, and thruſts them for ſhelter under its Tutelage. And give any man but this ſure Clue in his Hand, and how can he be loſt in the Labyrinth of Philoſophy? Tho his Principles, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes, or the ways he goes in, be very winding, croſs, and intricate; it will guide him quickly, and eaſily out them.</p>
               <p>The Second <hi>Expedient,</hi> whereby he ſhortens his work and makes it eaſy, is this. Where Objections are made that ought to be anſwered; he frequently <hi>paſſes them by with Silence:</hi> and ſometimes juſtifies his ſo doing, by ſaying <hi>the Theory is not concerned in them.</hi> As if ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arguments, or neglecting of them; were a ſufficient confuting them. A Practice agreeable to the Country mans purpoſe. Who being reſolved to argue with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacious <hi>Quaker;</hi> to his Friends diſſwading him, ſaid, hold your Tongues, for I will have a bout with him; and if he ſpeaks any thing that I cannot anſwer, I'll ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay nothing at all to it, or elſe face him down that 'tis nothing to me.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe two <hi>Shifts</hi> that he makes; he tells ſuch <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ntruths;</hi> and falls into ſuch <hi>Miſtakes;</hi> and is guilty of ſuch flat <hi>Contradictions</hi> to himſelf, as will yield no Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to a Son of Philoſophy. Leſt this charge, which may ſeem heavy, ſhould be ſuſpected to be falſe; in proof of its truth, the particulars are noted in the Margent of the Reply.</p>
               <p>As to his complaint of the Excepters <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfairneſs,</hi>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51858:5"/> adds, in way of aggravation, that this <hi>Edition</hi> was printed above a Twelvemonth before my <hi>Exceptions:</hi> My Exceptions, through the Printer's ſickneſs, were in the Preſs longer than ſo.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for a Writer to leave <hi>ſome</hi> very falſe things out of a <hi>Second</hi> Edition of his Book, which he taught in the <hi>Firſt;</hi> is not ſufficient. To leave them <hi>all</hi> out, is the leaſt he can do, even to make the very <hi>loweſt</hi> amends poſſible for the wrong done to Truth. But eſpecially if he injured <hi>Divine Truths,</hi> by confronting the Doctrine of the ſacred Bible, or by claſhing with its Hiſtory. And this is that which makes what the Theoriſt has done in this Caſe, to be ſhort and imperfect. <hi>All</hi> the things of this Nature and Tendency, are not <hi>left out</hi> of his Second Edition. And they who print things that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from Scripture, or are repugnant to it; will hardly make good men believe, that they do GOD right, by leaving <hi>ſome</hi> of thoſe Derogations or evil Repugnancies out of a <hi>Second</hi> Impreſſion, while they keep in <hi>others</hi> that are as bad. The Subject that libels his Princes Declaration <hi>highly</hi> to day, makes no ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſending out a <hi>lower</hi> Libel of it to morrow. No, his ſecond Act is an aggravation of his firſt; and as he is chargeable with, and anſwerable for either, ſo in point of Duty he is bound to moſt ſerious acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of both. And ſo is the Anſwerer to diſown <hi>all</hi> theſe notions (inſtead of defending them) which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon Scripture. And truly ſhould the <hi>Replicant</hi> go on to tax him with thoſe notions, as the <hi>Exceptor</hi> did; he would have no great cauſe to blame him for the procedure. For notwithſtanding that he has <hi>left them out</hi> of his Book, his Rejection of them is not ſo expreſs, but they ſeem yet to ſtand, as <hi>true,</hi> in his Judgment. For thus he openly declares,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> p. 66.</note> 
                  <hi>I have not from theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, found reaſon to change any part of the Theory, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51858:5"/> to alter my opinion as to any particular in it.</hi> And if his opinion of thoſe particulars, which we excepted againſt, and he has left out, be ſtill the ſame; the ſame Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might, without <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nfairneſs,</hi> be urged againſt him. Yea, his telling the Excepter, that his opinion as to the Theory is not <hi>alter'd,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. 79.</note> but <hi>more confirmed</hi> by his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; makes his <hi>anſwering</hi> Exceptions againſt it, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are <hi>left out;</hi> to be a meer <hi>Shift.</hi> Yet the Replicant takes but little <hi>farther</hi> notice of theſe things, as mentioning them but ſeldom, and on ſpecial Occaſion.</p>
               <p>That this Reply came out no ſooner, is owing partly to the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of it. I was willing to ſay what I had to ſay to this Anſwer (and ſo to the Theory) once for all; that then I might finally have done with it. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe many interruptions and frequent avocations that attend my Circumſtances. But chiefly to thoſe indiſpoſitions of health, which happened to me, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me, as to writing, for near a quarter of a Year together.</p>
               <p>And now if in ſome things, or places, it be leſs plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or profitable, than the Reader would have it; he muſt conſider this one thing.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51858:6"/> and <hi>the body of which muſt be</hi> DAILY <hi>increaſed;</hi> be made in <hi>ſix Minutes,</hi> even by <hi>Extraordinary Providence</hi> it ſelf? What made the Anſwerer ſtart out of the way of <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Providence, which he went in, as to the Earth's Formation; into this <hi>extraordinary</hi> one, to ſtumble into ſuch a <hi>Contradiction</hi> of himſelf? But ſo it is,<note place="margin">A Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf.</note> when men are pinched and put to pain, they muſt do and ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, tho it be little to the purpoſe, yea, much againſt it. And this grave diſtinction being beſtowed upon the firſt Exception, without more ado it is fairly dropt. And as for the Arguments contained in the reſidue of the Chapter, againſt <hi>undue protraction</hi> of the time of the Earth's Formation (which protraction is made neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the Theoriſt's Hypotheſis,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> even againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Hiſtory of <hi>Moſes</hi>) They are <hi>left to the Author and his Readers, the Theory being not concerned in them.</hi> And ſo they are anſwered by his <hi>Laſt Expedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I go farther, I muſt tell our Anſwerer, that in allowing this extraordinary Providence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns his Hypotheſis of extraordinary Impertinence. For what <hi>Need,</hi> or what <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> can there be of his <hi>New</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, as to ſolving the Phaenomenaes of the Flood; when by this Conceſſion, the <hi>old</hi> one will be inabled to the Solution of them all, for which his was invented?</p>
               <p>Thus, for example, was that World to be drowned, and the Flood to ſurmount the higheſt Hills, fifteen Cubits? Why, extraordinary Providence, in <hi>ſix Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,</hi> could create water enough to do it. Was that work done by ſuch a prodigious Flood, and the Maſs of Water to be dried up again? Extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could as ſoon annihilate it. Was the frame of the World to be inlarged upon the coming of ſo vaſt a quantity of new matter into it? And to be contracted again upon its going out? Extraordinary Providence could ſufficiently provide both againſt the one and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51858:7"/> other inconvenience. Were men to live a thouſand years before the Flood? The ſame Providence could effect this, without a continual Equinox, or an Earth univerſally paradiſiacal. And thus the Theory, inſtead of making any Figure here, is by its own Author made to dwindle into a Cypher and meer ſuperfluity. We hope that henceforward the old method of explaining <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, ſhall be allowed to be <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible:</hi> for <hi>that</hi> proceeded upon extraordinary Providence, and our Anſwerer is fain to make uſe of that kind of Providence in reference to his own Hypotheſis at laſt.</p>
               <p>Yea, the truth is, he is now glad, we ſee, to take up with it at firſt, and even to <hi>form</hi> his Earth by it. And yet he tells us, in the ſixth Chapter of the firſt Book of his <hi>Latin</hi> Theory (<hi>Edit.</hi> 2.) that this Earth was formed, <hi>ſolo ductu,</hi> by the <hi>ſole <hi>conduct</hi>
                  </hi> of the moſt known Laws of Gravity and Levity. And ſo this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Hiſtory. the Theory, is in good part, a <hi>Natural History</hi> of what was done by <hi>Divine Power;</hi> or an Hiſtory of an effect wrought by <hi>Extraordinary Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> which was done by the <hi>ſole conduct</hi> of <hi>Natures</hi> Laws and Principles. And therefore how <hi>true</hi> this piece of Natural Hiſtory is, and alſo how <hi>great,</hi> let the World judge; but if it be not extremely <hi>remarkable,</hi> I am much miſtaken.<note place="margin">Another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> And ſo I am if here be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction again.</p>
               <p>But tho our <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> as he pretends in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, be ſuch a friend to extraordinary Providence; yet it is evident, that the <hi>Theoriſt</hi> otherwhiles was not. For tho now his Earth (as he grants) might be made in <hi>ſix minutes;</hi> yet heretofore it was to be <hi>increaſed daily,</hi> and to be <hi>dried by degrees,</hi> before it could be habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: that is, it was to be formed in way of <hi>ordinary</hi> Providence. And in the ſecond Chap. of the firſt Book of his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theory, he tells the World plainly; that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51858:7"/> 
                  <hi>if we come to reflect ſeriouſly upon it, we ſhall find it <hi>extreamly difficult,</hi> if not <hi>impoſſible,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>to give an account of the Waters that compos'd the Deluge, whence they came and whether they went.</hi> And adds,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>to find Water ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for this Effect as it is generally explained and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, I think is <hi>impoſſible.</hi>
                  </hi> But had he been <hi>hearty</hi> for Extraordinary Providence, here would have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no difficulty, I am ſure; much leſs, extreme diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and leaſt of all, impoſſibility. For ſuch a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence could have <hi>created</hi> Waters to compoſe the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and then have <hi>annihilated</hi> them again: and as the quantity of them would thus have been ſufficient, ſo the account whence they came, and whither they went; would have been as eaſie.</p>
               <p>That this was one way in which ſome went, as to explaining the Deluge, according to the general or common Notion of it; the Theoriſt obſerved in his third Chapter. <hi>They ſay in ſhort,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Eng. The. p. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>God ALMIGHTY created waters on purpoſe to make the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and then annihilated them again, when the Deluge was to ceaſe.</hi> But how did he approve of this way? That will appear from what follows. Where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently complains,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> that this is to <hi>ſhow us the naked arm of Omnipotency.</hi> A ſight which he could not well brook in this caſe. And why? Why,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> becauſe <hi>this is to cut the knot when we cannot looſe it.</hi> Yet ſee the change; he is now fain to ſhow the <hi>naked Arm of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency</hi> himſelf; and to make uſe of the Knife of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providence, tho with it he cuts his own Fingers, as well as ſeveral knots of his Hypotheſis; as we ſhall ſee afterward.</p>
               <p>And thus we have gained one extraordinary Point. An Earth that before was to <hi>increaſe</hi> DAILY, <hi>in the Body or Concretion of it;</hi> and ſo might be ſix Days, or ſix Weeks, or as many Months, or Years in forming;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51858:8"/> might now by <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> be made in <hi>ſix Minutes.</hi> That is, our Author is brought to Croſs his Hypotheſis in this Matter. For now he ſuppoſes that his Earth might be formed in <hi>ſix Minutes</hi> by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Providence;</hi> whereas the Theory (as is plain from the cited Expreſſions) carries on its forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in way of <hi>ordinary Providence;</hi> according to which, the Formation of it <hi>would require <hi>much more time</hi> than ſix days,</hi> as he confeſſes, <hi>Anſw. p.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>THat the Moon was in the Heavens, and in our neighbourhood,<note place="margin">P. 5.</note> when the Earth was form'd, he proves from the ſix days Creation, ſays the Anſwerer, of the Excepter, here. But his Argument, he tells him, <hi>will be of no force, unleſs he can prove that the Fourth days Creation was before the Third.</hi> No? Who ſhall be Judge? Why one that the Anſwerer <hi>fairly</hi> appeals to, and one it ſeems of the Excepter's own chuſing, namely <hi>Scripture.</hi> (I and let the ſame Judge, ſays the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, decide the whole Controverſie betwixt us.) And what ſays this Judge to the caſe before him? Let all Philoſophers who pleaſe to be of the Jury, mind <hi>his</hi> ſentence, and alſo the <hi>Appellant</hi>'s Argument from it. <hi>The Moon was made the fourth day, and the Earth was formed the third.</hi> So ſays the Judge, and very truly. <hi>Therefore unleſs the fourth day was before the third, the Moon could not hinder the Formation of the Earth.</hi> So concludes the Appellant, and very falſely in the caſe depending. For the Earth formed the third day, was <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Earth; which the Excepter contends <hi>for,</hi> and could not poſſibly think that the Moon ſhould hinder the Formation of <hi>that.</hi> But the Earth he diſputes <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt,</hi> is the <hi>Theoriſt</hi>'s, which could not be form'd the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51858:8"/> third day. For, according to him, it was not only to grow out of a Chaos, by the riſing of Oyl out of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs, and the falling of Particles out of the Air; but moreover was to be <hi>increaſt <hi>daily.</hi>
                  </hi> And therefore had the Moon been made the <hi>fifth,</hi> or <hi>ſixth</hi> day, or <hi>after;</hi> it might have been made time enough to hinder the Formation of <hi>this</hi> Earth. But however he intimates here, that his Earth was form'd the <hi>third day.</hi> And that's mighty well; for now it's to be hop'd, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and he will agree better. Here's one ſtep towards an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. But then the miſchief on't is, 'tis a ſtep backwards on our Author's part, and I'm afraid will do him but little Service. For while he thus endeavours to ſhun <hi>Charybdis,</hi> he falls unluckily into <hi>Scylla;</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to ſuch an exigence, that let him chooſe which way he pleaſes of theſe two, he is ſure to go in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to himſelf.<note place="margin">Another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> For if he ſays his Earth was form'd the <hi>Third day,</hi> according to Scripture; he then contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himſelf in his Theory, which teaches it was <hi>daily <hi>increaſed.</hi>
                  </hi> And if he ſays it was <hi>daily</hi> increaſed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Theory; then he contradicts himſelf in his appeal to Scripture, which (as he now owns) tells us it was formed the <hi>third</hi> day.<note place="margin">Ib. lin. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> And ſhould it be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (to evade this) that here are two diſtinct Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes (that is to ſay, of <hi>Ordinary</hi> and <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Providence) whereon theſe two different Formations of the Earth are reſpectively founded; this would be but the ſame thing over again. As evidently ſhowing, that in his way of ſhifting, he has ſet up two Hypotheſes plainly contradictory to one another. Even as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, as affirming a thing made in <hi>one</hi> day, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming it made in <hi>many</hi> days; are contradictory affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51858:9"/> of the Chaos; <hi>that</hi> would have hindred the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Earth upon them. This, ſays the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>we have no reaſon to believe, according to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences we have now.</hi> For Tides hinder not the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Ice</hi> in cold Regions upon the Surface of the Sea: therefore why ſhould they have hindred the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Earth, upon the ſurface of the Chaos? Some Seas indeed do freeze in ſome meaſure; but then their waters are pretty <hi>ſtill.</hi> And ſo the moſt that can be inferred from thence is but this; that if the waters of the Chaos were any where <hi>ſo quiet;</hi> ſome Earth might there have been formed upon them. Tho this Inference withal is far ſhort of being an <hi>evidence</hi> of the thing; inaſmuch as there is <hi>more reaſon</hi> for <hi>Ice</hi> to be formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea, than there was for <hi>Earth</hi> to be formed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Chaos. For our Seas have <hi>Shoars,</hi> where Ice does uſually <hi>begin</hi> its Formation, ſpreading wider or farther by a continued or progreſſive Concretion. Which may be one chief reaſon why our Creeks or Harbours are oft frozen up (when Seas that feed or flow into them, are not) even becauſe they are bounded with no far diſtant Banks, where Ice can more eaſily grow from the Sides till it meets in the Middle. But the waters of the Chaos had no Shoars, Ice alſo is <hi>lighter</hi> than water, and ſo ſwims upon it; and therefore if fit chances to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in its firſt Formation, and while it is thin; it may unite and grow together again, by a new congelement. But earth is heavier than water, and apt to ſink; and therefore if broken when ſpread upon it in a thin Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, it immediatly dives and goes down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. And upon this account, the ſame degrees of Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuation that permit Ice to gather upon Seas; would have prevented an Earth's being formed upon the Chaos. But we muſt go on.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:51858:9"/>
               <p>The Theoriſt thought that the preſence of the Moon was <hi>leſs needful</hi> in the firſt World.<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>241.</hi>
                  </note> And one reaſon he gave for it was this; becauſe <hi>there were no long Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter nights.</hi> To which the Excepter oppoſed,<note place="margin">Diſc p. <hi>79.</hi>
                  </note> that as there were no long Winter nights, ſo there were no ſhort Summer ones neither. So that ſet but the one againſt the other, and the preſence of the Moon may ſeem to have been as needful then in regard of the length of nights, as it is now. But this in the Anſwerer's opinion, tho <hi>witty, does not reach the point.</hi> And pray,<note place="margin">p. 6.</note> why? why, becauſe <hi>a great Inconvenience</hi> attends long nights, when they <hi>fall upon the hours of travel, or the hours of work and buſineſs.</hi> But then at the ſame time that buſineſs and journeys are hindred in <hi>ſome</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by <hi>long</hi> Nights; in <hi>other</hi> places they are helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as much by <hi>ſhort</hi> ones.

Thus we ſee living Creatures grow fat by Nouriſhment. And many Plants turn the ſap they draw, into very Oil it ſelf; ſo that we need but extract it out of their Leaves or fruits.

               <p>Thirdly, it is alledged that theſe Oyly particles were Original,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, He argues that Oily particles might be Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, becauſe, according to <hi>D. Cartes,</hi> they were <hi>tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and branchy, too groſs to be Air,</hi>

                  <hi>and too light for Water.</hi> It ſhall not be ſaid that they are therefore a Compound of both; tho it may happen ſo in other Caſes. For ſome Bodies ſeem to be made of a middle Conſtitution betwixt thoſe which on both ſides ſtand next them, in neareſt degrees of Phyſical approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.

And certain it is, that ſome Oyls, by keeping, diſſolve into Liquors ſo thin and watry, that they will not burn; if that will give any countenance to the thought that water may be an Ingredient of Oyl. Tho it is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,<note place="margin">Prin. Phi. l. <hi>4.</hi> § <hi>76.</hi>
                  </note> that <hi>D.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51858:11"/> of that Matter wherein they were generated; which being of ſuch a Shape, caſt them (as Molds in which they were formed) into the like faſhion? Of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is that ingenious Philoſopher Mr. <hi>Rohault;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tract. Phyſ. Par. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>5.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Second thing which the Anſwerer obſerves to be charged with <hi>Precariouſneſs,</hi>

                  <hi>is the Separation of this Oily Matter, in due time, ſo as to make a mixture and concretion with the Terreſtial Particles which fell from above.</hi> And <hi>this Objection,</hi> he adds, <hi>was both made and anſwered by</hi> the Theoriſt.<note place="margin">Eng. The. p. <hi>58, 59.</hi>
                  </note> Now the Subſtance of his Anſwer was this. That the Maſs of the Air was many thouſand times greater than the Water, and would proportionably require a greater time to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd; the Particles in the Air having a far longer way to come to the watry Maſs, than the Oily Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles had to riſe to the Surface of it. That there might be Degrees of littleneſs and lightneſs in the Earthy Particles, ſo as many of them might <hi>float in the Air a good while.</hi> And laſtly, that the Air and the Water might begin to purify at the ſame time. But this Anſwer is ſhort and inſufficient; and therefore no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was taken of it formerly. But ſince we are urged with it now; to ſhew its lightneſs and incompetency, we Reply to it as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Air being a Finer Element than the Water; would begin its Purgation <hi>ſooner</hi> than That.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Tho the Air was far greater than the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet the Terreſtial Particles in it might ſooner reach the Water, than the Oily ones in the Water could riſe to the Surface of that, for ſundry Reaſons. As 1ſt, becauſe the Earthy Particles moved <hi>downward,</hi> and the Oily ones <hi>upward;</hi> and <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> the motion downward would be the ſwifteſt. 2ly, Becauſe the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51858:11"/> Earthy Particles were more <hi>dry</hi> and leſs <hi>clammy</hi> than the Oily ones; and their unctious moiſture by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them ſlimy, would make them ſluggiſh, and ſlacken their aſcent. 3ly, Becauſe the Air was a <hi>thin</hi> and <hi>yielding</hi> Medium, through which the Earthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles would more nimbly ſift down, than the Oily ones could wriggle up through the Water, which was more <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>groſs.</hi> 4ly, Becauſe the very <hi>Make</hi> of the Oily and Watry Particles is ſuch, that it would help towards their mutual <hi>Complication,</hi> which would retard their ſeparating; and conſequently the Aeral Maſs, would begin to refine <hi>before</hi> the Liquid one; and the Terreſtial Particles would have reacht the Water, <hi>before</hi> the Oily matter was riſen. For the Particles of Oil are of a <hi>ramous</hi> Figure, and therefore about them the <hi>long</hi> and <hi>flexible</hi> Particles of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would<note n="*" place="margin">That Watry Particles are naturally apt to lay hold of Oily ones, appears from the way of cleanſing Veſſels, into the Pores of which the Particles of Oil have in ſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or ſoaked. For out of thoſe their lurking holes, or little faſtneſſes, there is no fetching them but by the help of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And the ſame is clear from the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts Method of diſtilling Oils out of dry Bodies. For in order to that, they firſt ſteep and macerate them in Water; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which Preparative, there would be no extracting the Oily Matter fairly, by any force of Elicitation. But when through heat, the Water aſcends; in its fumes it ſnatches up the Particles of Oil, and makes that evaporate together with it ſelf.</note> be apt in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to twine and wind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Eſpecially at <hi>that</hi> time, when they both (upon the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Chaos) met and encountred one another in <hi>ſingle naked</hi> Particles, before ever they were once united in Bodies, or at all incorporated in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Maſſes. And altho by reaſon of their mutual Lubricity, the Watry Particles could not <hi>long</hi> keep faſt the Oily ones, about which they cling'd with tortuous flexures; yet they might conſiderably check and protract their ſeparation and aſcent; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring ſome time for the Oily Particles to extricate themſelves, and get looſe from thoſe little watry Wreaths wherewith they were involv'd and hampered.</p>

                     <hi>Eng.

Particularly the Water being a vaſt Body, would have ſent down its groſſer parts in great <hi>abundance</hi> of Sedimental Stuff. Now this Plenty of Sediment was thrown off by the Water, either <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> the Oily Matter was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, or <hi>in</hi> the very Riſing of it. Not <hi>after</hi> it was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen; for this Sediment being more earthy, and ſo more heavy than the Oil; it muſt be allowed to ſeparate as <hi>ſoon</hi> as that, or rather ſomewhat <hi>before</hi> it. And yet if it were diſcharged and ſank <hi>before</hi> the Oily matter was riſen, or <hi>when</hi> it was riſing how could it chuſe but ſweep away that, and carry it down together with it ſelf to the Bottom of the Abyſs? Or ſay, theſe Dreggs ſhould have been too weak or too light, to have overpowred the Oil alone, and to have ſunk it with its ſelf; yet it would certainly have <hi>arrested</hi> its motion upwards. By which means the Terreſtrial Particles above, taking the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thus given, would have come poudring down a main (faſteſt at firſt, and alſo the heavieſt of them) into the <hi>bare</hi> Waters; and ſo joining their inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Luggage, to the ſedimental Clog already hang'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Oily Matter, would have quite over-ſet it, and weighed it down to the Interior Earth. And this piece of work will appear the more fecible and eaſy to be done, if we conſider that it might be half, or better than half effected before. For all the Bodies or Elements of the Chaos, being of an <hi>Original</hi> or Primaeval Nature; and not one compounded or made out of another: we muſt ſuppoſe that before the very firſt reſolution of it, they did <hi>coexiſt</hi> in the Chaos in their ſeveral Principles or Particles; tho they were not locally ſevered, and made into diſtinct and ſpecifick Maſſes till its Separation.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51858:12"/> So that at the ſame time that there were <hi>Earthy</hi> Particles, there were <hi>Oily</hi> ones too, diſperſt throughout the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>whole Capacity</hi> of the Chaos. And conſequently when the groſſer earthy Particles gathered towards the Center of the Chaos; They ſalling through the <hi>whole</hi> Maſs (even through every little <hi>point</hi> or <hi>line</hi> of it, from its Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies downward) where theſe Oily Particles were dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and lay in their way; they muſt needs catch hold of the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of them (the rather for their being of a viſcuous quality) and bear them down with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Eſpecially they deſcending in ſo vaſt a Quantity, as to be able to conſtitute a central Earth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in caſe the <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Principle of the Chaos, would not thus have hindred the <hi>Oily</hi> Principle, from doing its part towards the Formation of the Theory's Earth; yet then the <hi>Liquid</hi> Part of the Chaos would have hindred the <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> one in the ſame Work. For how is it poſſible that an Ocean of Water and Oil, ſhould ſtrain through the whole Circumference of the Chaos, ſettling down towards the middle of it; and leave earthy Particles behind, floating in the Air, and that in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſufficient, upon their Deſcent, to compoſe ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe an Earth as ours? Let the Air be filled never ſo full of duſt, yet a thin Miſt preſently lays it all. And ſuch a prodigious Sea of Water falling through the entire ſpace of the Chaos; could not miſs of the like effect upon the Earthy Particles then in the Air; eſpecially that Water containing ſo much <hi>Oil</hi> in it. For by the Virtue of its Unctiouſneſs in conjunction with its Gravity, it would have cleanſed the Air of Earthy Particles (tho very throughly incorporate with it) as Izing-glaſs clarifies faeculent Liquors, by carrying their Dregs to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of their Veſſels. And therefore, whereas it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the pretended Anſwer, that through degrees of Littleneſs and Lightneſs in the Earthy Particles,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51858:13"/> 
                  <hi>many</hi> of them might float in the Air a <hi>good while:</hi>

                  </note> we may rather think there would have been <hi>very few</hi> of them, if <hi>any at all,</hi> left there. And then where would have been matter for the firſt Earth, ſuppos'd to be form'd upon the Surface of the Abyſs? So we paſs to the Third <hi>Precariouſneſs.</hi>

Cartes</hi>'s Hypotheſis, in the <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Inſtance</hi> here alledged; with that of the Theoriſt; we ſhall find it will acquit it ſelf much better than his.</p>
               <p>For ſuppoſe the World had been really to have been form'd out of the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Elements. Yet, upon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, it will appear, that they were leſs liable to juſt Exceptions, upon account of their poſſible <hi>Diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionateneſs;</hi> than the Chaos of the Theory, upon the ſame account, in regard of its <hi>Ingredients.</hi> For of theſe 3 Elements the <hi>entire <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> was to be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. So that if they had all of them been <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> in quantity; the Univerſe would only have had the <hi>larger,</hi> or <hi>ſtraiter</hi> Bounds. And if any of them ſingly had been exceſſive, or defective; nothing worſe would have followed upon this, but that the ſeveral Bodies made out of them reſpectively, muſt then have been proportion'd accordingly. Thus, if there had been
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51858:14"/> more, or leſs of the 1ſt Element, there muſt have been more, or greater; or fewer, or leſſer <hi>Suns.</hi> If there had been more, or leſs of the 2d Element; there muſt have been bigger, or leſſer <hi>Vortices.</hi> If more or leſs of the 3d Element; there muſt have been more, or leſs of <hi>Terreſtrial Matter</hi> in being. So that the worſt reſult from an exceſſive quantity of any one of the three Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments aforeſaid; would have been but an <hi>alteration</hi> in the Great World, or at moſt but an <hi>inconvenience</hi> here and there in ſome <hi>parts</hi> of it; no way detrimental or pernicious to the whole. But as to this Earth of ours, the caſe would have been quite otherwiſe. For had not the Materials of that been duly proportion'd, but one left to exceed and predominate over the other; this redundance, or inequality in meaſure, would have been of <hi>very fatal</hi> Conſequence. That is, it would have cauſed a <hi>miſcarriage</hi> in the production of the Earth, and have <hi>ruin'd</hi> the whole work which Nature was about. And therefore in making the Chaos into an Earth, there was abſolute neceſſity, as of Regularity of Proceſs in its Formation; ſo of due proportion in the Ingredients of its Conſtitution: otherwiſe it could never have been brought to Perfection.</p>
               <p>From <hi>D. Cartes</hi> the Anſwerer turns to the Excepter, and thinks to choak him with an example of his own. <hi>Does the Animadverter in his new Hypotheſis concerning the Deluge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 9.</note> 
                  <hi>give us the juſt Proportions of his Rock-water, and the juſt Proportions of his Rain-water, that concurred to make the Deluge?</hi> And does the Anſwerer think, that the like accurate Proportion of things, is needful to <hi>deſtroy</hi> a World, that is neceſſary to <hi>form</hi> or rear one? Yet here a World was to be <hi>destroyed</hi> only; to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by being drowned. Now ſuppoſing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Flood was to riſe out of Rock-water, and Rain-water; it mattered not, as to the Deſtruction
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51858:14"/> they were to bring on, if both were of equal Quantity, or which, and how much one exceeded the other, ſo they were together ſufficient for the Work. But what ſays the Anſwerer farther? <hi>I find no Calculations there</hi> (that is in the Animadverter's Hypotheſis) <hi>but general Expreſſions, that one</hi> (ſort of Water) <hi>was far greater than the other: and that may be eaſily preſumed concerning the Oily Subſtance and the Watry in the Chaos.</hi> Here he muſt be minded of one of theſe two things: that is to ſay, either of <hi>Shuffling,</hi> or of <hi>Miſtaking.</hi> Firſt, of <hi>Shuffling.</hi> For he inſtanceth only in the <hi>Oily Subſtance</hi> and the <hi>Watry</hi> in the Chaos, which he thought might ſhift pretty well together, tho the one in Quantity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the other. But he knows there was a <hi>Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subſtance</hi> too; and what would have become of his Paradiſiacal Earth which was to riſe out of that, if the Oil had not been fitly proportion'd to it? If it had not been juſt enough, that is, to mix with the Earthy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, and to make them into a good Soil. For if it had been <hi>more</hi> than was ſufficient to that purpoſe,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>80.</hi>
                  </note> it would have overflowed them, and rendred the Earth uſeleſs as a Greazy Clod. If <hi>leſs,</hi> it would not have imbib'd them, but they muſt have lain looſe above in a fine and dry powder, that would have made the Earth barren as an Heap of Duſt. And this, in theſe very words, the Excepter told the Theoriſt before. Yet here we ſee the <hi>Earthy Subſtance</hi> is taken no notice of, but rather ſlily ſhuffled out of the way. Unleſs he intended that what he ſaid of the <hi>Oily</hi> and <hi>Watry</hi> Subſtances, in the Chaos, ſhould be meant of the <hi>Earthy</hi> one too. And then</p>
               <p>Secondly, he muſt be put in mind of a groſs <hi>Miſtake.</hi> For tho in <hi>our Waters</hi> that <hi>Drowned</hi> the Earth, one ſort may <hi>eaſily</hi> be allowed to be greater than the other: yet the ſame thing cannot <hi>be eaſily preſumed</hi> concerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51858:15"/> 
                  <hi>his Materials</hi> ſuppoſed to <hi>form</hi> it. For Rock-water and Rain water were both alike for Drowning, and ſo equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fitted to ſerve that End whereunto they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and the Exceſs of one above the other, could be no hindrance of the Effect they were deſign'd to produce. Yea, without ſuch an Exceſs, the Effect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, could never have been wrought; according to <hi>our</hi> Hypotheſis of the Flood. But Oily Liquor and Earthy Particles, are very different things; out of a well proportion'd mixture of which the Earth it ſelf was to be made. And therefore to <hi>preſume</hi> the<note n="*" place="margin">The Oil, that is, far greater than the Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſubſtance; or that unduly proportion'd to the Oil.</note> one was <hi>far greater</hi> than the other, is to preſume they were not duly proportion'd or mixt together; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently that the Earth could not be raiſed out of them.</p>
               <p>But we muſt not forget the Cloſe of this Paragraph, which runs in theſe Words. <hi>What Scruples therefore he raiſes in reference to the Chaos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>againſt the Theoriſt, for not having demonstrated the proportions of the Liquors of the Abyſs, fall upon his own Hypotheſis, for the <hi>ſame</hi> or <hi>greater</hi> reaſons. And you know what the old verſe ſays;</hi> Turpe eſt Doctori, cùm culpa redarguit ipſum.</p>
               <p>Here he goes on in his ſhuffling or miſtaking Way ſtill. For he ſpeaks of Scruples raiſed <hi>in reference to the <hi>chaos</hi>
                  </hi> only; whereas this refers as well to the <hi>Formation of the Earth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>80.</hi>
                  </note> And he proceeds upon the <hi>Proportions of the <hi>liquors</hi> of the Abyſs</hi> only; whereas our Scruples re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as well to the <hi>Earthy Matter.</hi> Let <hi>that</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded therefore, as it ought; and then what he ſays, will in plain terms amount to thus much. That tho the Rain-water were far greater than the Rock-water; yet there would have been greater reaſon why the Earth ſhould not have been drowned: than there would have been why the Earth ſhould not have been formed, tho the Oily ſubſtance had been far greater than the Earthy. For the Scruples againſt the Theoriſt's Formation of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51858:15"/> Earth, can never, for <hi>greater reaſon,</hi> fall upon the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter's Hypotheſis concerning the Flood; unleſs there be greater reaſon why vaſtly diſproportionate Quantities of Oily and Earthy Subſtance ſhould make an Earth; than there is why the like diſproportion'd Quantities of Rock-water and Rain-water ſhould make a Flood. Now have we greater reaſon to think that a little Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtial Matter, mixt with a vaſt deal of Oily matter, ſhould compoſe the firſt Earth: than we have to think that a little Rock-water mixt with a vaſt deal of Rain-water, ſhould drown it? There is <hi>great</hi> reaſon why one Tun of Rock-water, mingled with an hundred thouſand Tuns of Rain-water, ſhould drown a good Garden. But is there <hi>greater</hi> reaſon why one Tun of Earthy matter, mingled with an hundred thouſand Tuns of Oily matter, ſhould make a good Garden Soil? I hope, tho our Anſwerer be too great a Favourer of many Abſurdities, he will not be forward to aſſert this.</p>
               <p>Rock-water and Rain-water were <hi>ſimilar</hi> Cauſes, and could not but with equal readineſs of natural Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſpire to the effect of Drowning. And tho the one, in meaſure, was much inferior to the other; yet if both of them in conjunction, were but ſufficient for the Inundation; that was enough: for the Deluge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended chiefly upon the <hi>quantity</hi> of Water in general, and not upon the <hi>Proportion</hi> of this or that kind of it in Particular. But Oily matter and Earthy matter are <hi>Heterogeneal</hi> Subſtances, and therefore could not ſo readily and immediately conſpire to the Earth's Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some <hi>other Helps</hi> conducive thereunto, were to come betwixt <hi>them</hi> and <hi>that;</hi> and <hi>Concretion</hi> for one. But then Concretion depending upon the <hi>due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Ingredients; <hi>Due Proportions</hi> of Oily, and Earthy matter, muſt be <hi>more</hi> needful in forming the Earth, and ſo ought to be <hi>better</hi> demonſtrated; than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51858:16"/> of Rock, and Rain-waters in raiſing the Flood. And thus it is manifeſt, that the Scruples raiſed againſt the Theoriſt by the Animadverter; fall not upon his own Hypotheſis, for the <hi>ſame</hi> or <hi>greater</hi> reaſons. He might well therefore have ſpared his <hi>old verſe;</hi> which as appli'd here, was as inſignificant as an <hi>old Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack.</hi> But ſince, in Civility to the Excepter, he would needs ſend him it; he cannot, but in kindneſs, give him a piece of it back again: Letting him know, that to reaſon, or anſwer at ſuch a rate as this, <hi>Turpe eſt Doctori.</hi>

                  </note> and the Sphaere of its Gravity reached as high as the Moon, or they did not. If they did not, how could theſe Particles ever come there at all, or come down from thence? If they did extend ſo high, then as the Excepter quaeried at firſt, ſo he does ſtill; why did not the Moon come down with thoſe Particles? It is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by another Queſtion;<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>10.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>why does not the Moon come down now? the ſame reaſon which keeps her up now, kept her up then.</hi> But this Anſwer, is no Anſwer: for that which kept the <hi>Moon</hi> up <hi>then,</hi> would have kept up theſe <hi>Particles</hi> too. And ſo either there muſt have been <hi>no</hi> Earth compoſed; or elſe the <hi>Moon</hi> as an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus muſt have dropt into its compoſition.

And then how could thoſe terreſtrial Particles deſcend, that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſt in all that vaſt ſpace, contain'd between the heighth of the Bullets aſcent, and the orb of the Moon?</p>
               <p>The Laſt Charge upon the Theory in this part, was its being <hi>Anti-ſcriptural.</hi> That is, in making the Chaos <hi>Dark,</hi> whereas the Scripture ſays, there was <hi>light the firſt day.</hi> He anſwers to this ſence.<note place="margin">

                  </hi> Not that I reflect upon the Doctor for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation here; I note it rather in his commendation. And the more any man does of this nature (where there is cauſe for it) and the farther he goes in this way; the more laudable will his action and procedure be.</p>
               <p>Having done with the Chapter, he muſt now take the Excepter to task. And it ſeems he was in a great fault, where he little thought of being ſo. The Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt doubted whether the Moon was in our Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood before the Flood, and he argued in Defence of this Doubt.<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>78.</hi>
                  </note> This, ſaid the Excepter, is <hi>too bold an Affront to Scripture.</hi> But, ſays the Anſwerer, a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man <hi>is not forward to call every croſs word an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>10.</hi>

It is ſaid in the Inſpired Writings,<note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 7.16.</note> that King <hi>Solomon made <hi>two</hi> Chapiters of Braſs.</hi> Now ſhould any man doubt and diſpute this, and offer to prove that he made but <hi>one;</hi> ſurely here would be <hi>too bold an affront</hi> to Scripture, tho the things were little and of low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. The ſame Writings aſſure us, that GOD, upon the 4th Day, made <hi>two great Lights</hi> (things of an higher Nature and Uſe) for they were to give Light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51858:17"/> the Earth; the one for the benefit of Mankind, ruling the Day; and the other, the night.) The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriſt queſtions this, diſputes againſt it, and offers to prove that inſtead of <hi>two</hi> Lights, GOD made but <hi>one.</hi> And muſt not the words ſpoken by him here, be <hi>too bold an affront to Scripture?</hi> And if they <hi>be</hi> ſo, <hi>diſcreet</hi> men may be allowed to call things as they are. Beſides, the Excepter had never ingag'd with the Theoriſt, but to ſhew how <hi>croſs</hi> his Aſſertions lie to Scripture; and had he not pointed out what was <hi>too bold</hi> and <hi>affronting</hi> that way, he muſt net have been diſcreet indeed, as neglecting what was moſt proper for his purpoſe. And laſtly, who muſt be moſt <hi>indiſcreet</hi> of the two, he that <hi>puts</hi> the affront upon Scripture, or he that <hi>minds</hi> him of it?</p>
               <p>But he has ſomewhat <hi>more</hi> againſt us yet, for mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the Affront he put upon Scripture. And it is this. <hi>Suppoſe a man ſhould ſay boldly,</hi>

                  <hi>GOD Almighty <hi>has no right hand.</hi> Oh might the Animadverter cry, <hi>that's a bold affront to Scripture:</hi> for I can ſhow you many and plain Texts of Scripture, where expreſs mention is made of GOD's <hi>right hand.</hi>
                  </hi> But let him ſhow us <hi>one</hi> plain Text of Scripture which <hi>means</hi> that God has a <hi>real</hi> right hand: That he has as <hi>really</hi> a right hand, as he did <hi>really</hi> make two great Lights.

Yet this angular interſection holds, tho, it is thought, ſome Mechanic or Phyſical Cauſes would bring them nearer to the ſite we ſpeak of.

As alſo the <hi>Experience</hi> we have now, of the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Frozenneſs of thoſe parts of the Earth.</hi> And what ſays he to theſe our Reaſons? As to the <hi>Diſtance</hi> of the Sun, he would make the Excepter anſwer that Himſelf, bringing him in thus. He confeſſes,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>That <hi>is not the thing that does</hi> only <hi>or</hi> chiefly <hi>make a climate</hi> cold.</hi> Ay, and that Confeſſion he keeps to ſtill, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Suns Diſtance be <hi>Perpendicular,</hi> which was the Diſtance he ſpake of.<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>118.</hi>
                  </note> But if the Sun moved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Aequinoctial, his Diſtance from the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumpolar or Raining Regions, muſt be an <hi>Oblique</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. And if that Diſtance were but as great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sun and the imaginary Raining Regions, as
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51858:20"/> it is betwixt the Sun and us, in the Depth of Winter; it may from hence be concluded, that the Cold in thoſe Regions muſt be as great, as, in Winter time, it is in ours, by reaſon of his diſtance.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Obliquity</hi> of the Sun, the Anſwerer ſays it was neither ſo <hi>great nor ſo conſiderable in the firſt Earth as in the Preſent.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> But tho the <hi>Obliquity</hi> of the Sun be greater now, becauſe the body of this Earth lies in an oblique Poſition to him: yet his <hi>Diſtance</hi> from <hi>us</hi> in Winter is far <hi>leſs</hi> now, in this preſent Earth, than his Diſtance from the Raining Regions was in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Earth. Becauſe that being an oval or Oblong Earth, its circumpolar Regions muſt be far more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from the Equator,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſcourſe c.</hi> 5. § 4.</note> than if it had been Round or Globular. And ſo the Raining Regions then, muſt be much colder than our Climate is now, in the dead of Winter. For as it is not the Diſtance of the Sun alone, that makes a Climate vehemently cold; ſo it is not his Obliquity alone, that does it neither; but a <hi>great</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Diſtance. And ſo great and conſiderable muſt the Sun's Diſtance of this Nature be, from the Raining Regions in the Primitive Earth; as to leave them in a very freezing Condition. Eſpecially if the <hi>Experiences</hi> alledged by the Excepter be well conſidered:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> to which there is nothing diſtinctly anſwered. Inſtead of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to take off them, the Anſwerer is pleas'd to tell us thus.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>14.</hi>
                  </note> That <hi>if the Excepter had well conſider'd the differences betwixt the preſent and the primitive Earth; as to Obliquity of Poſition, and that which follows from it, length of nights: he would have found no reaſon to have charg'd that Earth with nipping and freezing Cold; where there was not, I believe, one morſel of Ice, from one Pole to another.</hi> As to his <hi>belief,</hi> who can regard it? It comprehends ſuch things, as no Chriſtian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher ever yet did, nor ever <hi>can,</hi> or <hi>will</hi> put into his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51858:20"/> Creed. And as for the Fxcepter, he has <hi>well conſider'd</hi> the things he ſpeaks of; and ſtill finds he has ſufficient reaſon, to charge the primitive Earth in its Rainy Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, with Nipping and freezing Cold: even with a Cold more nipping and freezing, than is felt in our Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in the <hi>Winter Seaſon.</hi> Indeed he inſtances in one thing in this preſent Earth, which he thinks ſhould caſt the Advantage, for Coldneſs, on our Climate's ſide; that is, the <hi>Length of Nights.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid</note> But conſider all Circumſtances aright, and the real Advantage as to Cold, will appear to be with the Firſt Earth; its Rainy Regions muſt be colder than ours. For in that Earth the Nights were continually <hi>twelve</hi> hours in length; and in our Climate, if we take one with another, throughout the Winter Months, we ſhall find that <hi>our</hi> Nights do not <hi>much</hi> exceed thoſe in Length. For tho in <hi>December,</hi> they be above <hi>four</hi> hours longer than they; yet in <hi>February,</hi> they are never longer by <hi>two</hi> hours and an <hi>half,</hi> and in the <hi>end</hi> of that Month, but little above half an hour. And then to counter-ballance, or weigh down this ſingle Difference, in length of Nights (the pretended Cauſe of prevailing or exceſſive degrees of Cold, in this preſent ſtate of Nature, beyond what could be in the praediluvian World) we hinted ſeveral <hi>other</hi> Cauſes of vehement Cold in <hi>that</hi> World,<note place="margin">Diſc. Chap. <hi>5:</hi>
                  </note> which are not in <hi>this;</hi> tho the Anſwerer takes no notice of them. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, upon ſuppoſition that <hi>That</hi> Earth was Oval, the Wet Regions in it, muſt have been <hi>ſeveral hundreds of Miles</hi> farther removed from the Sun, than our Climate is; and ſo the Cold there muſt have been proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſtronger.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the primitive Earth there was no <hi>Clouds;</hi> which contribute much towards warming the Air. That is, as they reverberate or beat back the Beams of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51858:21"/> Sun, reflected from the Earth: As they ſtraiten and compreſs Vapours in their Motion and agitation: And as, (at ſome times, and in ſome meaſure) they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Coeleſtial Rays, not altogether unlike to Burning-glaſſes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in the firſt Earth there was no <hi>open Seas;</hi> which fill the Air with Miſts, and Foggs, and great ſtore of Vapours, that do mightily thicken it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently mitigate the ſharpneſs of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There was no <hi>Hills</hi> nor <hi>Valleys,</hi> Rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes nor Inequalities upon the Surface of that Earth; which cauſe Heat again by confus'd and irregular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of the Sun-beams.</p>
               <p>Now put but theſe <hi>Four Cauſes</hi> of Cold (extant in the firſt World) into the Scales, againſt <hi>the Length of Nights</hi> in the Second, which the Anſwerer inſiſts upon; and they will not fail to weigh it down ſufficiently. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we add, that in <hi>our</hi> Nights, ſhorter, by <hi>near Four</hi> hours, than thoſe before the Flood; we have ſometimes very brisk kind of Froſts. In the <hi>Beginning,</hi> that is to ſay, or in the <hi>Middle</hi> of <hi>May;</hi> when the Sun is far advanc'd on our ſide of the Equator, in a World that has Clouds, and Seas, and Hills.</p>

                  </note>As to the <hi>other part</hi> of the Exception, <hi>Theſe Rivers could not have been made in <hi>due time:</hi>
                  </hi> He anſwers thus. <hi>That's wholly according to the Proceſs you take; if you take a meer natural Proceſs, the Rivers could not flow through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Earth, all on a ſudden: but you may accelerate that proceſs, as much as you pleaſe, by a Divine Hand,</hi> And ſo this is anſwered by the <hi>first Expedient; Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providence:</hi> which is here at a Pinch, brought in again, to ſerve this Extraordinary Hypotheſis. And thus indeed there might be Rivers for Fiſhes, and a River in Paradiſe; and the one as ſoon, and the other as great, as needed to be; even as big as <hi>Euphrates</hi> it
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:51858:21"/> ſelf. Here therefore this Controverſie muſt end, for who can ſtand out againſt ſuch an Anſwer? Only, we muſt ſay, it is a very <hi>Philoſophical</hi> one; and 'tis pitty he made not ſhorter Work in the Caſe. For he might have told us, that Men, and Animals, and all kind of Plants, by the power of a <hi>Divine Hand,</hi> lived <hi>without water</hi> before the Flood; and then he had ſav'd himſelf the whole trouble, as well of raiſing, as of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating his Rivers. And truly ſo difficult a Work is the latter of theſe,<note place="margin">Another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</note> that it will coſt him no leſs than a <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> to do it. For he tells us in his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Theory (p. 228.) that the <hi>derivations of the waters, at firſt would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry irregular and diffuſe, till the Channels were a little worn and hollowed.</hi> And (p. 229.) that <hi>the Current would be eaſie and gentle all along, and if it chanc'd in ſome places to reſt or be ſtopt, it would ſpread it ſelf into a pleaſant Lake, till by freſh ſupplies it had raiſed its waters ſo high, as to overflow and break looſe again.</hi> Now when at firſt there were no Rivers, but <hi>diffuſed</hi> waters; and afterwards they were to flow in Channels <hi>worn</hi> and <hi>hollowed</hi> by themſelves: When their Currents were to be <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>gentle all along,</hi> and to <hi>reſt,</hi> and <hi>ſtop,</hi> and <hi>ſpread</hi> at places, till they waxed ſtrong enough to run forward: Were theſe waters <hi>accelerated by a divine hand?</hi> No more than what is <hi>natural,</hi> is at the ſame time <hi>miraculous:</hi> No more than what is <hi>ſlow,</hi> is at the ſame time <hi>ſwift:</hi> Or than flat Contradictions can fall in with truth.</p>

               <p>PART of the Theoriſt's Deſign, in explaining the Deluge his way, was to <hi>ſilence the Cavils of Atheiſts.</hi>

                  </note> And accordingly he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that <hi>the Deſign of his Treatiſe is to ſhow a way of making the Deluge fairly intelligible, and accountable without creating of new waters.</hi> And in another place, <hi>explaining the Deluge in a natural way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>or by natural Cauſes;</hi> he makes theſe Cauſes to be <hi>Vapours</hi> within the Earth, and <hi>Rains</hi> without it, and <hi>Cracks</hi> and <hi>Chaſms</hi> made by the Sun in the Arch of it. All which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cauſes together, brought on the Diſruption of that Earth, and this Diſruption occaſion'd the Innundation. But if his Hypotheſis which takes off <hi>one</hi> Miracle, brings on <hi>another;</hi> or (as the event of things might prove) makes it neceſſary to ſuppoſe <hi>another</hi> Miracle interwoven with the Contexture of it: it will then contribute juſt <hi>nothing</hi> towards <hi>ſilencing</hi> the Atheiſt, who cannot poſſibly be reconciled to Miracle, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing principles moſt repugnant to it. Now the great Flood being made, by the Theory, an Effect of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Cauſes; it muſt needs have come on in a Courſe of Nature. Yea, tho it was to come as a Judgment upon obſtinate Sinners; yet it muſt have hapned <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably</hi> tho Mankind had been <hi>Innocent,</hi> or truly <hi>Penitent:</hi> unleſs the power of a <hi>miraculous</hi> hand, had forcibly ſtopt the Courſe of Nature, and held her from running on into this otherwiſe certain and inavoidable iſſue. And when it is as neceſſary to <hi>admit</hi> Miracle into this <hi>new</hi> Hypotheſis; as it was to <hi>allow</hi> it in the <hi>Old;</hi> how is the Atheiſt <hi>ſilenced</hi> by it? Yea, when he ſees this Hypotheſis making Ruine the Lot, either of a righteous, or repenting World; this muſt open his mouth, inſtead of ſilencing his tongue, and make him more fierce and clamorous than ever. This is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51858:22"/> Subſtance of the Excepter's Sixth Chapter, which runs upon what the Cavilling Athieſt would be apt to alledge, againſt the Theory of the Flood.</p>
               <p>It is anſwered thus.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>What the Excepter ſuggeſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Athieſts, and their preſum'd Cavils at ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Deluge, is a thing only ſaid at random and without grounds.</hi> And why ſo? Surely it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſomething the Anſwerer had ſaid before.<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>18.</hi> p. <hi>19.</hi>
                  </note> Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>GOD's Praeſcience is infallible, and God is the Author and Governour of the Natural World, as well as of the Moral: and he ſees thorough the Futuritions of both, and hath ſo diſpos'd the one, as to ſerve him in his juſt Judgments upon the other.</hi> But is this to ſatisfy or <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> the Athieſt? Can the Anſwerer think, that he who denies the being of a GOD, ſhould acknowledge his Attribute? and conſent to a Providence directed by <hi>Proeſcience?</hi> This is as much as to ſay, let an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſt become <hi>no</hi> Atheiſt, and then he will ſilence this Athieſt's Cavils</p>
               <p>The Two Queſtions he puts in the Beginning of his Chapter, touching GOD's Praeſcience; are little to the purpoſe. Inaſmuch as the Athieſt, whom the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter juſtly brings in (the ſilencing of his Cavils being the aim of the Theory) does abſolutely diſown and diſavow the Property, together with the Eſſence of the GLORIOUS DEITY. However let us reply to theſe Queſtions; that nothing may ſeem to be paſs'd over, which but looks as if it required an Anſwer.</p>
               <p>The firſt Queſtion is this. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> Adam <hi>had not ſinn'd, what would have become of the</hi> Meſſiah,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel?</hi> Why, then the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> need not have been born, nor need the Goſpel have been diſpenſed. And truly both the Incarnation of the one, and the Diſpenſation of the other, might have been prevented or put by; without any ſtop or interruption
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51858:23"/> in the Courſe of nature, made by the intervention of a miraculous Power. But the like cannot be affirmed of the Deluge. For had that been put off, the order of Nature muſt thereby have been broken; and the hand of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence muſt have ſupported the Earth by the ſtrength of Miracle. Elſe in a certain period of time, (in that Juncture ſuppoſe, when the Flood, according to the Theory, fell out) it muſt have ſuffered Diſruption; and have ſunk into the Abyſs.</p>
               <p>But it is farther urged, that the Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is ſaid to be very <hi>early determin'd:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is. It muſt be allowed therefore that <hi>that</hi> Determination had reſpect to mans Sin. But that the like may be allowed to the Theory of the Flood, it muſt be prov'd as well, that the Deluge was <hi>decreed</hi> or <hi>determin'd</hi> to come in, according to <hi>its</hi> Method. And where has Scripture determin'd <hi>that,</hi> as it did things relating to the Bleſſed MESSIAH, and his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goſpel? But This, believe it, is a lofty Inſtance to be fetcht down into compariſon with a phanſiful Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis. The next therefore is of a lower ſtrain, upon which the Second Queſtion runs; which is This.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
                  <hi>Suppoſe</hi> Adam <hi>had not eaten the forbidden Fruit; how could he, and all his Poſterity have liv'd in Paradiſe? A few Generations would have fill'd that place, and ſhould the rest have been turn'd out into the wide World, without any ſin or fault of theirs?</hi> To it we Reply,</p>
               <p>Firſt; that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not eaten the foibidden fruit; yet it does not appear that he and all his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity were to have liv'd in Paradiſe. For That, in a few ages, might not only have been ſufficiently reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht, but overcharg'd with Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Secondly; when that place had been filled, and <hi>the reſt,</hi> (as the Anſwerer expreſſes it) muſt have been <hi>turn'd out into the wide World:</hi> yet they (being without
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51858:23"/> ſin) ſhould not have felt the Inconveniences which <hi>we</hi> do. For as the <hi>Barrenneſs</hi> of the Earth; ſo, <hi>many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences</hi> (perhaps ſecondary Cauſes of it) might proceed from the Curſe of GOD, pull'd down upon the Ground by the ſin of man. And thus much <hi>Moſes</hi> has left upon record; that as the Earth by GOD's bleſſing brought forth uſeful Products, while man ſtood, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12. ſo <hi>Thorns and Thiſtles</hi> were the juſt effect or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.18. But then as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer has noted, that <hi>a Supernatural curſe might have its effect in any poſition of the Earth:</hi> ſo it is as certain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 29.</note> that a ſupernatural <hi>Bleſſing</hi> might have its proper effects too. And if GOD, as he ſays,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>can make a Land bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, if he think fit, in ſpite of the Courſe of Nature:</hi> then in ſpite of the Courſe of nature, he can as well make it fruitful and pleaſant. And therefore <hi>ſo</hi> he might have made the Praediluvian earth (had not <hi>Adam</hi> eat the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit) notwithſtanding its oblique Poſition to the Sun. Then, as there ſhould have been no Death amongſt men; ſo there ſhould have been nothing like it, or tending to it. No ſuch exceſſive heat and cold, as now rage in ſeveral Climates: No ſuch noxious Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and Exhalations, as now riſe from, or breath out of the Earth: No ſuch impurities and unwholſom corruptions, as now breed in, and diſtemper the Air: No ſuch bluſtring Storms and violent Tempeſts, as now diſquiet, and toſs, and cauſe Breaches by the Sea: No ſuch mighty Floods and dreadful Earthquakes, as now do unſpeakable Miſchiefs at Land.

               <p>When <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſs'd through the <hi>Arabian</hi> Deſert, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a choſen and peculiar People, and dear unto his MAJESTY; the ALMIGHTY ſav'd them from the great Inconveniences of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate Region, by miniſtring to their Wants, moſt ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſeaſonable Defenſatives and Supplies. Thus, the Drieneſs of the place, and the lack of Waters; he ſupplied by the ſtreams from Rocks, Its Barrenneſs, or lack of Food; by Quails and Manna. Its heat and lack of ſhades; by a Cloudy Canopy. Its Wildneſs, and lack of Roads and Way-marks; by the Pillar of a Cloud, guiding them by day, when their Camp moved; and by a Pillar of fire leading them by night. The lack of new Cloaths, and the lack of new ſhooes; by the laſtingneſs of their old ones, and by their not wearing out. And when the Good GOD had ſuch care and kindneſs for a ſinful People; yea, for a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, perverſe, and provoking Generation; as thus to ſence and furniſh them againſt the moſt grievous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Inconveniences, that could readily beſet them: we may well conclude how tender he would have been of an Innocent World, and how inconceivably gracious and indulgent to them, in the like Nature. The <hi>wide World</hi> therefore ſhould not have been <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity (as this World now is to <hi>us</hi>) if he had not eaten the forbidden fruit. The ſupernatural Bleſſing of Heaven, would then have made their Circumſtances happy upon Earth. Nor ſhould they ever have overſtockt it, tho they had multiply'd never ſo faſt. For ſtill as they grew aged, that they might not grow too numerous, they might, in due time, have been tranſlated hence, as <hi>Enoch</hi> was, to the higher State of bliſs and felicity. Nor is there any thing here overſtrain'd in the leaſt. For tho we muſt not be too bold with Extraordinary Providence in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51858:24"/> Philoſophic Schools; it was ever a ſtanding Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis in the Church. And upon the principle of it, the moſt glorious Phaenomenaes of heavens kindneſs, that have been, or can appear, are properly to be ſolved.</p>

Or who can clearly diſcern, and juſtly dinſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Wilful</hi> Ignorance; and rightly determine which of the two, men are guilty of in all caſes? It is hard to ſet an exact boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary, between <hi>Willing</hi> and <hi>Wilful</hi> Sin; ſo as poſitively to ſay, where the one ends, and the other begins. The Difference here is ſo nice and obſcure, as not eaſily to be diſcovered. If we look to the ſins of the Tongue; they that Ly and Swear Willingly; commonly do it Wilfully. If we look to the ſins of the Hand; they that Rob and Kill willingly; commonly do it wilfully. And ſo it is commonly as to ſins of the mind, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to the ſin of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> They that are <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly</hi> ignorant, are <hi>wilfully</hi> ignorant. For they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ignorant, becauſe they forbear to conſult men; or becauſe they neglect to peruſe Books; or becauſe they refuſe to obſerve, or conſider, or examine things. And theſe Omiſſions being deliberate, choſen, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; muſt conſequently be <hi>wilful,</hi> and make their ignorance of the ſame ſtamp.

But the doing of this, he either willingly, or wilfully omitted; it being much eaſier to run out into an empty debate about a word; than (as he ſhould have done) to purſue the proper and material things. He ſays indeed (p. 20.) <hi>The mutability and changes of the World, which theſe Pſeudo-Chriſtians would not allow of, was a <hi>knowable thing,</hi> taking all the</hi> means <hi>which they might and ought to have attended to.</hi> Great news this, that the Changes of the World, which they were checked for being ignorant of, <hi>were knowable by the means which they injoyed.</hi> Did GOD ever blame ignorance, but in ſuch Circumſtances?

               <p>He goes on next, to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.7. <hi>He gathereth the waters of the Sea,</hi>

                  <hi>as in a Bagg: He layeth up the Abyſſes in Store-houſes.</hi> Which, according to the Theory, hints that the Sea or <hi>Abyſs before the Deluge, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within the Vault of the Earth.</hi> In confutation of this Phantſy,<note place="margin">So the <hi>Vulgate</hi> and <hi>Septuagint</hi> both render it: which the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt quoted for rendring the forecited place, <hi>Pſal. 33.7. as in a bag.</hi>
                  </note> the Excepter brought in that Paſſage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.13. <hi>He ſet the waters as in a Bag.</hi> Which proves (according to the known Rule of Expounding one Scripture by another) that by the waters being as <hi>in a bag, Pſal.</hi> 33.7. could not be meant their being <hi>incloſed within the vault of the Earth.</hi> Becauſe this Text, which ſays the ſame thing, ſpeaks of an <hi>open</hi> Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> the Red Sea;<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 139, 140.</note> and that when it was <hi>ſo</hi> open, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> marched through it. How does the Anſwerer take off this Objection? Why, becauſe the Excepter had ſaid, that <hi>as in a Bag, Pſal.</hi> 33.7. Should be rendred, <hi>as on an heap;</hi> and proved it by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities: he gives him leave to render <hi>this</hi> place ſo, <hi>as on an heap. For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it was done by a miracle.</hi> But if when by miracle the waters in an <hi>open</hi> Sea ſtood on an <hi>heap,</hi> they were ſaid to be in a <hi>Bag:</hi> then this ſhows <hi>more plainly</hi> ſtill, that that Expreſſion, <hi>He gathereth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51858:26"/> the waters of ahe Sea as in a <hi>bagg,</hi>
                  </hi> can be no manner of proof that they were ever <hi>inclos'd</hi> within the Vault of the Earth. And at laſt indeed he in effect confeſſes that he miſ-interpreted the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s words. For he declares now, that that <hi>other place (Pſal.</hi> 33.7.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note>) <hi>ſpeaks of the <hi>ordinary</hi> poſture and conſtitution of the Waters; which is <hi>not on an heap,</hi> but in a <hi>level</hi> or ſpheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal convexity with the <hi>reſt</hi> of the Earth.</hi> And thus he catches himſelf in a trap. For if the Text ſpeaks of the <hi>Ordinary</hi> poſture of the waters, lying in a <hi>Level</hi> with the <hi>reſt</hi> of the earth;<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>86.</hi>
                  </note> why did he wreſt and miſapply it, by making it ſpeak of an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> poſture of them (an invention of his own) whereby they lay <hi>within</hi> the <hi>Vault</hi> of the Earth?</p>
               <p>But the Excepter muſt not eſcape here neither.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>21.</hi>
                  </note> For he complains of him for an <hi>unfair citation of a Paragraph of the Theory, which he applies peculiarly to this Text of</hi> Pſal. 33.7. <hi>whereas it belongs to all the Texts alledg'd out of the</hi> Pſalms, <hi>and is a <hi>modeſt</hi> reflection upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them.</hi> Now if the Paragraph belonging to <hi>all</hi> thoſe Texts did agree properly with <hi>none,</hi> and with <hi>one</hi> leſs than with the reſt; ſurely the Excepter might, without <hi>unfairneſs,</hi> cite and apply it to <hi>that</hi> one, without meddling with the reſt. And ſo the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint is frivolous. Tho how <hi>modeſt</hi> the Reflection he ſpeaks of, was, he may conſider; when it backs ſuch an <hi>explication</hi> of Scripture, as would make <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews</hi> paſs <hi>thorow</hi> a Sea,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 140.</note> which at the <hi>time</hi> of their paſſing, was <hi>inclos'd</hi> within the <hi>Vault</hi> of the Earth.</p>
               <p>He proceeds next to <hi>Job</hi> 26.7. <hi>He stretcheth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</hi> But how can this moſt aptly agree to the ſtructure of the Theory's firſt Earth? when (as the Excepter noted) the Theory it ſelf teſtifies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>142.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51858:28"/> of GOD. For ſo is this very</hi> Egypt, Gen. 13.10. <hi>tho it had no Rain, but was water'd by Rivers. And</hi> Lot <hi>lifted up his eyes, and beheld the plain of</hi> Jordan, <hi>that it was well watered every where, (before the LORD deſtroyed</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrha) <hi>even as the Garden of the LORD, like the Land of</hi> Egypt. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the greateſt commendation of a Land, for pleaſure and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, according to Scripture, is its being well watered with Rivers.</hi> But that's more than the cited Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſpeaks, and more than it means; as will appear if we conſider the Occaſion of the Words, which is this. <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> were both very rich in Cattel. Their Stocks were ſo numerous, that the Tract of land where they abode together, was not able ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to feed them: for their Shepherds ſtrove one with another for paſture. This made it neceſſary that they ſhould ſeparate; and accordingly they agreed to do. <hi>Lot</hi> having liberty to chuſe his ſtation, or the place where to ſettle himſelf; takes a view of the Plain of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and makes choice of that. And the chief reaſon why he choſe it, was upon the account of its being <hi>well water'd.</hi> And how well watered was it? Why, <hi>every where</hi> very well for the <hi>nouriſhing of Cattel,</hi> it being as well ſupply'd with <hi>River-waters,</hi> as a pleaſant Garden, or <hi>Egypt.</hi> I ſay, as a <hi>pleaſant Garden.</hi> For were the <hi>true Paradiſe</hi> meant here; <hi>Egypt,</hi> by being compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that (which was certainly the ſweeteſt place in the World) would have been preferable to <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> Whereas 'tis evident that GOD prefers <hi>Paleſtine</hi> to <hi>Egypt, Deut.</hi> 11.10. But therefore there is no neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that this <hi>Garden of the LORD,</hi> ſhould be the real Paradiſe. For the word <hi>Lord,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> is commonly joined to ſeveral things in Scripture, in way of ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or to ſhow the greatneſs and extraordinarineſs of them. Thus we read of the <hi>Terror of GOD, Gen.</hi> 35.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51858:28"/> 5. that is, an extraordinary terror. And of the <hi>Sleep of the LORD,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.12. that is, an extraordinary Sleep. And of the <hi>Trees of GOD, Pſal.</hi> 104.16. that is, extraordinary Trees. So here the <hi>Garden of the LORD,</hi> ſignifies no more than a pleaſant garden extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily watered. And therefore, ſays the <hi>Interline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Gloſs,</hi> it was <hi>hortus delicioſus &amp; irriguus;</hi> a delicate and well watered Garden.</p>
               <p>But ſtill notwithſtanding this, a Land watered with <hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Showres</hi> at once, may <hi>excel</hi> a Land watred with Rivers <hi>only.</hi> And upon this account Scripture commends <hi>Paleſtine</hi> above, and prefers it much before <hi>Egypt.</hi> Even becauſe it being happy in <hi>Rains,</hi> as well as in <hi>Rivers;</hi> it was free from that great trouble and ſlavery of <hi>watering with the foot,</hi> to which <hi>Egypt,</hi> through want of Rain, was ſubject. Thus the hard task which the Anſwerer conceited he put upon the Excepter,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> when he bad him <hi>conſider how he would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and apply his place in</hi> Deuteronomy, <hi>and make it conſiſtent with this in</hi> Geneſis; is done with eaſe. For albeit <hi>Egypt</hi> was as well water'd as a pleaſant garden, in reſpect of <hi>River-water</hi> (it being water'd by the overflowing of <hi>Nilus</hi>) yet it was not ſo well water'd as <hi>Paleſtine;</hi> which beſides a ſufficiency of <hi>Rivers,</hi> had moreover the benefit of <hi>ſeaſonable ſhowres</hi> ſuperſeding the trouble, of watering <hi>with the foot.</hi> Tho withal we muſt here note, that he would have put a trick upon us. For whereas he ſays, <hi>Egypt,</hi> a Country that had no Rain, is compared or join'd in priviledge with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe;</hi> it is not ſo. For the <hi>whole</hi> Country of <hi>Egypt</hi> is not brought into this Compariſon or Privilege; but only a <hi>Part</hi> of it leading to <hi>Zoar,</hi> better water'd than the Reſt. But theſe words, <hi>as thou comeſt unto</hi> Zoar, he left out of the Quotation; which ſhould have been in it, not only to perfect the Clauſe, but to clear the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51858:29"/> ſenſe. So that <hi>Paleſtine</hi> had ſtill <hi>more reaſon</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before <hi>Egypt</hi> in general, becauſe it was but one <hi>particular Part</hi> of it, which was reſembled to a fine garden; and that but in one <hi>particular thing</hi> neither, its being water'd by <hi>Rivers.</hi> Which tho they ſuted <hi>Cattel</hi> beſt, were not ſo convenient for <hi>Corn,</hi> as Rains: Which where they do not fall; the ſeed ſown requires manual waterings. And thus at laſt, the thing is fairly come about again, and <hi>we</hi> are juſt where we were at firſt, and ſo is <hi>Egypt</hi> too. For GOD, in <hi>Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> compar'd it to a Garden of herbs, where the ſeed ſown was to be watered with the foot: and here in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> to a pleaſant Garden, which by reaſon of its Rivers, could want no water convenient for that uſe. But ſtill 'twas ſhort of <hi>Paleſtine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for his <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the place in <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> which he <hi>likes</hi> ſo <hi>very well,</hi> (Namely, <hi>that they were not to expect ſuch a land as</hi> Egypt, <hi>that was a Plain naturally fruitful, as being well water'd; but the land they were to poſſeſs depended upon the Benediction of Heaven; and therefore they might expect more or leſs fertility,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>24.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>according as they kept God's Commandments:</hi>) it is improper, and ill grounded. For it ſuppoſes the fruitfulneſs of a Land, cauſed by <hi>Rains,</hi> to be <hi>leſs natural,</hi> than that cauſed by <hi>Rivers,</hi> and it ſuppoſes the overflow of Rivers, to depend <hi>leſs</hi> upon GOD's <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> than the Downfal of Rains. Whereas they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both alike natural, and their Dependence upon GOD's Benediction, equal; the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had as much reaſon, and as great obligation upon them, to keep GOD's Commandments in <hi>Egypt,</hi> as in <hi>Canaan,</hi> whither they were going. Yea, (if a compariſon muſt be made) all things conſidered, they might ſeem to have better grounds for expecting fertility in <hi>Canaan,</hi> upon their obedience; than they could have in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:51858:29"/> For rains depend <hi>ſolely</hi> upon Providence. (And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the giving of Rain, is all along aſcrib'd to GOD, in Scripture: And of the <hi>four Keys</hi> which the Rabbies put into the ALMIGHTY's hand, the Key of the <hi>Clouds</hi> is one.) But the regular and fruitful Overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Nile,</hi> depends not only upon the providence of GOD, but upon the pleaſure of a great man,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heylyn, Coſmog.</hi> in his Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia Superior.</hi>
                  </note> the <hi>Abaſſine</hi> Emperour. For to him, as one tells us, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> pay tribute, to have the Flooding <hi>Nile</hi> kept within compaſs. And tho Providence can eaſily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule Emperors, yet it muſt be allow'd, that <hi>they</hi> may well be more refractory than the Clouds. And thus again <hi>Paleſtine</hi> has another Advantage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that it pays no Fees for any Rivers or fruitful Showres. It is generally attended with that privilege, which <hi>Caleb</hi> gave his Daughter, as an acceſſion to her Fortune:<note place="margin">

                  </hi> But inſtead of removing our Objections, the Anſwerer brings in two of his own; which the Replicant will not anſwer, as he does the Excepter's.</p>
               <p>The firſt is this. <hi>If you underſtand the</hi> Womb of Non-entity;<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>25.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the Sea broke out of that womb the firſt day, and had no bars or doors ſet to it, but flow'd over all the Earth without check or controul. Therefore that could not be the time or ſtate here ſpoken of. And to refer that reſtraint, or thoſe bars and doors, to another time, which are ſpoken of here in the ſame verſe, would be very inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in the Excepter: ſeeing he will not allow the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to ſuppoſe thoſe things that are ſpoken of in different Verſes, to be underſtood of different times.</hi> Now pray, what is the <hi>difference</hi> betwixt the time of the Sea's breaking forth of the womb, and the time of its being reſtrain'd with doors; that the Excepter ſhould be ſo <hi>very inexcuſable,</hi> for <hi>allowing</hi> that difference? It was but the ſpace of <hi>one</hi> poor day. And truly if he had <hi>not</hi> allowed of this difference; when GOD Himſelf <hi>ſignifies,</hi> that he made the breaking forth of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51858:30"/> into <hi>being,</hi> part of his <hi>firſt</hi> day's work; and the gathering them together into one place (the <hi>decreed place</hi>) where they were ſhut up with bars and doors, his <hi>Third</hi> days work: he muſt have been <hi>very inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable</hi> indeed. O but therefore the Excepter is <hi>very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable,</hi> becauſe <hi>he will not allow the Theoriſt to ſuppoſe thoſe things that are ſpoken of in different verſes, to be underſtood of different times.</hi> Be it ſo. But were the different times of the <hi>Theoriſt</hi> then no more <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> than the different times of the <hi>Excepter?</hi> The ſpace between the <hi>Excepter</hi>'s times, was one <hi>ſingle</hi> day: <hi>that</hi> between the <hi>Theoriſt</hi>'s times, was more than ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years. And yet let him bring but as good authority for the Different times which <hi>he</hi> contends for, as the Excepter does for <hi>his</hi> different times (which GOD has clearly diſtinguiſht by different works; his <hi>creating</hi> Waters on <hi>one</hi> of the times, and his <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting</hi> and <hi>confining</hi> them on the <hi>other:</hi>) and his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times will by all be allowed. But becauſe he can bring no <hi>ſuch</hi> authority, nor any at all beſides his own; not the Excepter, but he himſelf, muſt be the <hi>very inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable</hi> perſon in this Matter.</p>
               <p>His ſecond Objection runs thus.<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>This Metaphyſical notion of the</hi> womb of nothing, <hi>is altogether impertinent, at leaſt in this caſe: for the Text is plainly ſpeaking of things local and corporeal, and this priſon of the Sea muſt be underſtood as ſuch.</hi> Muſt it ſo? What neceſſity is there for it? None at all but to ſupport the Theoriſt's ſinking Hypotheſis. And for him to ſay it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo underſtood in favour of that; is to beg the Queſtion. And however that may be leſs metaphyſical, it will be more <hi>impertinent,</hi> than our Notion is. For <hi>that</hi> we can preſently make very pertinent, by a way which himſelf juſt now cut out. <hi>Foundations</hi> and <hi>Corner-ſtones</hi> are as <hi>local</hi> and <hi>corporeal</hi> things, as the reſt which the Text

But who is impertinent for ſuggeſting it was not ſo?</p>
               <p>The laſt place is <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.27, 28. <hi>When he prepared the Heavens, I was there; when he ſet a compaſs upon the face of the deep,</hi> &amp;c. That by the word, <hi>Compaſs</hi> here, could not be meant the <hi>firſt habitable Earth,</hi> as a Sphaere, Orb, or Arch in the beginning ſet round the Abyſs, according to the Theory: the Excepter ſhewed very plainly.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>which we render</hi> compaſs, <hi>he</hi> (the Excepter) <hi>ſays, ſignifies no more than the <hi>rotundity</hi> or <hi>ſpherical figure</hi> of the Abyſs.</hi> Let the Anſwerer ſhow where the Excepter ſays thus.

And are either of theſe, the <hi>Rotundity</hi> or <hi>Sphaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal figure</hi> of the Abyſs? Yet if they are not, (as they cannot be;) has not the Anſwerer done manifeſt wrong to the Excepter, by ſuggeſting a vain Phantſy or Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his <hi>own,</hi> and fathering it upon <hi>him,</hi> as his? This, to <hi>ſpeak freely,</hi> is fencing with an unlawful Weapon, which never commends either the Skill or Ingenuity of them that uſe it. He might therefore as well have wav'd the falſe charge here, by which he would turn the point of non-ſenſe upon the Excepter. For what can be more highly nonſenſical, than to ſay that the

And muſt it not be true then that the Earth never cut the Equinoctial, by paſſing (as ſhe is now preſum'd to do) from one Tropic to the other?

                  </hi> Or could the Anſwerer <hi>perceive</hi> (as his word is) that the Excepter <hi>thought</hi> it did ſo? Then his Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more quick than true.

And therefore if Paradiſe ſtood in a pleaſant and temperate Region of the Earth (as who can think otherwiſe?) they may be ſuppoſed (for a great while) to abide in the <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> of it. Fourthly, Suppoſe them baniſht which way you will, and as far from it as you pleaſe; yet they could have needed no Coats to <hi>defend them from Cold,</hi> in caſe the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's Hypotheſis were true.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eng. Theor.</hi> p. 251:</note> For according to that, in the primaeval Earth, <hi>we have every where through the temperate Climates, <hi>all</hi> the general Characters of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, ſo that the trouble will be rather in that competition,

But GOD being pleaſed to make them ſuch Coats to defend them from the Cold, this ſubverts the General Paradiſiacalneſs of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Earth, and conſequently its Equinox; by imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was a cold or intemperate air, in the habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parts of it.</p>
               <p>The Anſwerer proceeds thus in the next Paragraph. <hi>After <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I expected no more:</hi>

                  <hi>but he hath two or three Reaſons after the Laſt.</hi> Thus he cannot forbear playing upon the Excepter, tho he does it with the worſt luck that ever man had. For even by this Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (intended to diſparage <hi>him</hi>) he only expoſes <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> by betraying and proclaiming his own Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.

                  </note> But ſtill the <hi>Reaſons</hi> againſt the <hi>Equinox</hi> alledged in that Chapter, might follow in their due Courſe or Order.

               <p>The next Argument of the Excepter's againſt the Equinox, is,<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>171.</hi>
                  </note> That it would have kept one Hemiſpaere of the terreſtrial Globe <hi>unpeopled.</hi> For grant <hi>Adam</hi> to have been planted on either ſide of the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> ſuch was the fiery heat thereof, that neither <hi>he</hi> nor <hi>his</hi> could have gone through it to the other ſide.

               <p>Another Reaſon brought by the Excepter why there could be no Equinox,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>174.</hi>
                  </note> is, that it would have <hi>put by the Rains</hi> which help'd to <hi>raiſe the Flood.</hi> And here the Philoſopher is fain to run to his old Refuge again, and to anſwer (by the ſame <hi>Expedient) That thoſe rains that made the Flood were <hi>Extraordinary,</hi>

                  <hi>and out of the courſe of Nature.</hi> But this is little leſs than giving up his Hypotheſis; at leaſt it is condemning it as weak and inſufficient. And truly what Hypotheſis, tho never ſo mean and full of Defects, would not ſupport it ſelf under all its flaws and imperfections, by ſuch a lawleſs liberty as this? A liberty of recourſe to <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> and of bringing in <hi>Miracles,</hi> and the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery</hi> of Angels, to help to take off and ſolve thoſe Difficulties, which puzzle its Author, and baffle its Principles.

               <p>But here the Anſwerer is plainly for <hi>ſhifting,</hi> to avoid a blow; which, for <hi>that,</hi> falls but the heavier upon him. The Theory, ſaid the Excepter,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>175:</hi>
                  </note> will have the Rains to be <hi>antecedent</hi> to the Deſcription of the Abyſs:<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>98.</hi>
                  </note> And he quoted theſe words, in proof of it. <hi>I do not ſuppoſe the Abyſs broken open till after the forty days rain. But then,</hi> adds the Excepter, <hi>this is moſt directly againſt Scripture; for that plainly affirms, that the Fountains of the great Deep, and the windows of Heaven were both open'd on <hi>one day,</hi> Gen.</hi> 7.11. Now to ſalve this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy to Scripture, the Anſwerer here declares, that <hi>he does not ſuppoſe the <hi>Cataracts of Heaven</hi> to have been open'd before, which made the <hi>Grand</hi> rains.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> But then he muſt ſuppoſe that there were <hi>two</hi> forty-days-rains; one, <hi>before</hi> the Abyſs was broke up, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>beginning</hi> with it, and <hi>continuing</hi> after it. But is not <hi>this</hi> alſo as much againſt Scripture, which owns but <hi>one</hi> forty-days rain, that commenc'd with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? And truly had the Vapours of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere been exhauſted (as they muſt have been) by the <hi>firſt</hi> continued forty-days rain (according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer's Suppoſition;) where could have been a ſupply for the <hi>ſecond</hi> forty-days rain (eſpecially when the Rains that fell then, were to be <hi>grand rains</hi>) without a <hi>new Creation</hi> of Waters, which the Theory <hi>deſignedly</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? And then the LORD ſaid unto <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Yet ſeven days, and I will cauſe it to rain upon the Earth forty days and forty nights.</hi> And is it likely that GOD would have given that Preſerver of the World notice, that Rains to make the Flood, ſhould <hi>begin</hi> a Week <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> if it had already rained for three and thirty days <hi>before,</hi> or for above a Month paſt?</p>
               <p>Laſtly, againſt the Equinox it was ſuggeſted, that Authors of all ſorts have diſputed,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>176.</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51858:36"/> Which hints that there was not any <hi>one Seaſon</hi> through all the Earth at once. But the Anſwerer inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, that upon Suppoſition of an Equinox according to the Theory,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>31.</hi>
                  </note> it might be ſo. <hi>And why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>may not that have given occaſion to the general belief,</hi> that the World began in the Spring?

And as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable Circumſtances in their Allegations, will inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate them in matter of fact: ſo impoſſible ones, if mingled with them, will quite overthrow them. The true caſe of the Teſtimonies before us. They contain ſuch improbable and impoſſible things, as do not only weaken, but deſtroy them. Should twenty Mariners confidently affirm, that they ſailed in a Ship from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Calice,</hi> by a brisk Gale out of a pair of Bellows: tho this be a matter of fact, muſt they not be reckoned
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:51858:36"/> notorious Lyars? Or if forty Engineers ſhould poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwear, that the Powder-mill near <hi>London,</hi> was lately blown up, by a Mine then ſprung at Great <hi>Waradin</hi> in <hi>Hungary;</hi> muſt they not be grievouſly perjur'd Perſons? And the Philoſophers atteſting the Earth's Inclination, having charged their Evidence with as great Impoſſibilities; the Reports they make, muſt be as little credible. Or let us take the Inſtance which the Anſwerer gives, the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> War.<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> If the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian that writes it, had told that the Souldiers who fell in it, fought only with <hi>Sun-beams,</hi> and <hi>ſingle Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants</hi> which grew thereabouts; and that hundreds and thouſands were ſtabb'd with the one, and knockt on the head with the other: who would believe that ever there were ſuch Weapons in that war; that ever there was ſuch a fatal War in that Country? Yet as poſſible it was for multitudes of men to be kill'd by theſe Inſtruments; as for the Poſition of the Earth to be chang'd by thoſe Cauſes, which were aſſign'd by the Theory's Philoſophic Witneſſes. For how could the Southern Pole of the Earth dip into the Air, through exceſs of heat, or exceſs of Fruits thereabouts; when at both Poles the heat of the Sun was equal, and ſo was the fatneſs and fertility of the Soil? (See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 180, 181.) Or if theſe were the Cauſes of that great Effect, why then was it not wrought ſooner, than at the end of above ſixteen hundred and fifty years? And yet theſe very Cauſes being not only brought into their Evidence, but made as true and expreſs a <hi>part</hi> thereof, as the Inclination of the Earth it ſelf; their Teſtimonies muſt extend to both alike: and in caſe the one be of doubtful credit, the other muſt be the ſame. Yea, the one, according to their Allegations, being <hi>Cauſes,</hi> and the other but an <hi>effect</hi> of them; if they be falſe witneſſes as to the <hi>Cauſes</hi> upon which the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51858:37"/> 
                  <hi>Effect,</hi> according to their evidence, had its <hi>whole</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; their <hi>Teſtimonies,</hi> as to the <hi>Effect,</hi> muſt needs fail and be nothing worth. For they plainly aſcribing it to cauſes that were not,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>he</hi> aſſerted that an huge ſtone at the River <hi>Aegos</hi> in <hi>Thracia</hi> fell down from the Sun. And he being a Principal Witneſs of the change of the Earth's Poſition: the Excepter brings in this againſt him to weaken his evidence.

Nor could he ſlip into this Error by chance, nor could he mean any thing elſe by the Aſſertion, than what he expreſſed; becauſe it agrees ſo well (as the Excepter obſerved) to the <hi>strain of his Philoſophy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib.</note> it being ſutable to his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of <hi>generating Stars out of Stones.</hi> Now that man (be he who, or what he will, even <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> himſelf) who is guilty of <hi>one</hi> ſo abominably groſs and ſhameful an Heterodoxneſs in Aſtronomy; is certainly as like to be guilty of <hi>another, as any of the Learned:</hi> and therefore the Cenſure cannot be <hi>Groundleſs.</hi> Nor is it <hi>Rude.</hi> For firſt, as we ſee, it is well grounded.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>but only to ſignify—that in any dark or doubtful opinion, we have no reaſon—to lay the ſtreſs of our belief upon his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, — contrary to the whole World of the Learned.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Pliny</hi> paſs'd an <hi>heavier</hi> Cenſure upon him, which hitherto was never ſaid to be <hi>rude.</hi> For ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Anaxagoras,</hi> and this ſtone which he phantſied fell out of the Sun:<note place="margin">Nat.

                  <hi>Farewel the knowledge of Natures works,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and welcome confuſion of all, in caſe we ſhould believe it.</hi> And how could he poſſibly reflect more <hi>highly</hi> upon an eminent Philoſopher, than to make him the Author of ſuch an Aſſertion, or to make him the Patron of ſuch an opinion; as if People had believ'd it, would have let confuſion into the World, by baniſhing natural Philoſophy out of it? Is not this a <hi>more rugged</hi> Cenſure, than ſaying <hi>he was a man as like to be Heterodox, as any of the learned Ancients?</hi> Yet who ever call'd it <hi>Rude?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how extravagant ſoever <hi>Pliny</hi> thought him, the Anſwerer takes him to be very excuſable. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly offers to make his excuſe <hi>two</hi> ways. Firſt, by ſaying, that <hi>we are not to imagine,</hi>

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51858:38"/> Notion of theirs. Secondly, by ſaying, that his Aſſertion <hi>of a Stone that fell from the Sun,</hi> cannot be <hi>literally</hi> true.<note place="margin">Ib.</note> And therefore like a witty Mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt, he interprets it of the <hi>Incruſtation of a fixt ſtar, and its deſcent into the lower World.</hi> But did ever any ſtar come down ſo low, as to reſt upon the Earth?

Yet all theſe Circumſtances (beſides the generating of Stars out of ſtones, which is capable of no very clever Mythological Expoſition) belong to <hi>Anaxagoras</hi>'s monſtrous Aſſertion, according to the account that is given us of it. And if it be not <hi>truly</hi> his; and if it be not <hi>literally</hi> true: let the Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er blame <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Laertius</hi> for making it ſo. But they <hi>two</hi> are the <hi>very authors</hi> out of whole Books he cites his Teſtimonies, for the Earth's changing of its Poſition. And we only bring in a <hi>third</hi> Perſon, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſame ſtory (of this ſtony fiery fallen ſtar) for a <hi>literal</hi> truth; namely <hi>Pliny.</hi> And his Authority can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but help much to confirm the thing, he being well known to be no trivial Writer.</p>
               <p>But does not the Anſwerer forget himſelf in this caſe? Is there not a greater than <hi>Anaxagoras</hi> here? What thinks he of <hi>Moſes?</hi> We might fill many Pages with his glorious Character, and yet come ſhort of his real worth. Let us only note that Encomium therefore which the H.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51858:38"/> more <hi>rude</hi> to this great and illuſtrious Prophet; than the Excepter was to the aforeſaid Philoſopher?

                  </hi> And ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Ancient Earth and Abyſs (p. 93.) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers himſelf thus. <hi>If they were in no other Form, nor other ſtate than what they are under now, the <hi>expreſſions</hi> of the Sacred Writers concerning them are very <hi>ſtrange</hi>
                  </hi> and <hi>inaccountable, <hi>without</hi> any ſufficient ground, <hi>or</hi> any juſt occaſion <hi>for ſuch</hi> uncouth repreſentations.</hi> Some perhaps may ſee as much <hi>rudeneſs</hi> here, as in any thing that the Excepter ſaid of <hi>Anaxagoras.</hi> And ſhould abſolute ſtrangers to his Religion read this Author: they might poſſibly be apt to think, from many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in his books, that inſtead of <hi>believing</hi> theſe ſacred Writers in ſeveral Matters; he deſigns to <hi>confute</hi> them. And ſhould they at the ſame time be ſtrangers to theſe Writers too, they might be apt to think alſo that they <hi>deſerve</hi> to be confuted, or that they were not <hi>worth</hi> confuting. For to ſay that their <hi>repreſentations</hi> of things are <hi>uncouth,</hi> and that their <hi>Expreſſions</hi> are <hi>occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs</hi> and <hi>groundleſs,</hi> and <hi>very ſtrange,</hi> and <hi>inaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;</hi> is the ſame thing as to ſay that they writ non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe. Theſe are our Authors words: and if we will believe him (who muſt needs know beſt) he finds <hi>no reaſon to alter his Opinion in any one particular.</hi> And when he can thus expreſs himſelf of <hi>ſacred Writers,</hi> becauſe their Doctrines differ from his Notions: is he not like to be thought by ſome, to be as deep in the dirt of <hi>rudeneſs,</hi> as the Excepter is in the mire, for ſaying what he did of an heathen Author?</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> the Anſwerer ſays, <hi>he might have added the Teſtimonies of Poets,</hi> who tell us of a <hi>perpetual Spring.</hi> And particularly he quotes <hi>Ovid</hi> for it.

                  <hi>The empty ſpace betwixt the exterior Region of the Earth, and the Abyſs below, would be fill'd with ſuch groſs vapors, that it would be little purer than water: and would ſtick to the Earth much cloſer than its Atmoſphaere that is carried about with it.</hi> But this ſhaft alſo, tho levell'd more directly at it, miſſes the intended Scope. For if thoſe Vapours were but a <hi>little purer</hi> than water, yet look how much they were ſo, and ſo much the weaker they

And that <hi>groſſeſt</hi> Vapours are <hi>very much</hi> purer or thinner than water, is evident from hence; that they cannot ſuſtain or buoy up a piece of light Cork; whereas upon waters, ſhips of greateſt Burthen float and ſwim. And tho the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphaere be carried about with the Earth; yet if that were incloſed with an oblong or Oval Orb of Earth; this Orb would not ſit half ſo faſt and ſteddy upon that Sphaere of Vapours, as it would do upon a Sphaere of Waters: the Conſiſtency of Water being many times as thick again, as any Maſs of Vapours can be, in their natural Conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The Second Query is this. Granting there was ſuch an Equinox in the firſt World,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>187.</hi>

                  <hi>Would not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural day, towards the latter end of that World, have been longer, than in the former periods of the ſame?</hi> Yet that the days juſt before the Flood were of no unuſual length, is evident in the very Story of the Flood; the Duration of which we find computed by Months con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Thirty days apiece. Whereas, ſays the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter, had Days been grown <hi>longer, fewer</hi> of them would have made a Month. <hi>This,</hi> ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>is a meer Blunder.</hi> And he proves it thus. <hi>If thirty days were to go to a Month,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>28.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>whether the days were longer or ſhorter, there muſt be thirty of them; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does not determine the length if the days.</hi> Tho Scripture does not limit or account for the length of days expreſly, yet it does it implicitly, and withal very plainly and intelligibly. For it gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that days before the flood, were of the ſame length that they are of now; by informing us that months and years which were of the ſame length then, that they are of at preſent, were made up of the ſame numbers of days. For how could there be juſt <hi>twelve</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:51858:41"/> Months in the Year, at the time of the Deluge, and <hi>thirty</hi> days in each of thoſe Months; if days then had not conſiſted, as they do now, of four and twenty hours a piece? And as Providence has ſo ordered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that days (which depend upon its <hi>Diurnal</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) ſhould be meaſured by Circumgyrations of the Earth: So it has order'd likewiſe that Months (which depend upon its Annual Motion) ſhould be meaſured by its progreſs in the Heavens. And as it has ſo ſuted theſe Motions, that the Earth, while it makes a Month, by running from one <hi>Sign</hi> in the <hi>Zodiack</hi> to another; ſhould turn about thirty times upon its own Axis, and thereby make ſo many Days: So it has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care, that each of theſe Circumrotations ſhould be perform'd in four and twenty hours, and conſequently that every day ſhould be juſt ſo long; that thirty of them (in way of round reckoning) might compleat a Month. But now had the Circumgyrations of the Earth grown more <hi>ſlow</hi> towards the Deluge (by ſuch cauſes as the Excepter ſuggeſted) ſo that every day had conſiſted of <hi>thirty</hi> hours, ſuppoſe: it is manifeſt that <hi>fewer</hi> than thirty days (they being <hi>longer</hi> than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) muſt have made a Month. Becauſe then before the Earth could have turned round thirty times; ſhe would have been tranſlated, by her progreſſive motion, from one Celeſtial Conſtellation to another; and ſo the Month would have been conſummated. But to talk, as the Anſwerer does, that the Month ſhould be lengthened by the days being ſo; is a fearful <hi>Blunder</hi> indeed. Tho as luck will have it ſtill, it falls upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. For let the days (by ſlackning of the Earth's Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnal motion) have been never ſo long; yet (its Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al motion continuing the ſame) the <hi>Month</hi> muſt needs have kept its <hi>uſual</hi> Length; only <hi>fewer</hi> days would have made it up; the very thing objected.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:51858:42"/>
               <p>The Anſwerer therefore need not have been ſo offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, as to undertake to teach the Excepter to ſpeak: which he was pleaſed to do in theſe Words.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>30.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>I ſuppoſe that which he would have ſaid, and which he had confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly in his mind, was this; That the</hi> Month <hi>would have been longer at the Flood, than it was before.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer it ſeems, had ſuch a <hi>confuſed</hi> thought in his mind; but the Excepter ('tis plain) was clear from it. And truly had he been guilty of it, he ſhould have counted it a <hi>Meer Blunder.</hi> For how could the <hi>Month</hi> be <hi>longer,</hi> for the <hi>Earth's</hi> Circumgyrations being <hi>ſlower;</hi> when the Month was meaſured by ſuch a motion of the Earth, as would have continu'd as ſwift as ever, tho its Circumgyrations had been never ſo ſlack? The Moon never turns circularly upon her own Center, to make days and nights; and yet ſhe makes regular Months and Years by her Periodical and Synodical Courſes. And had the Circumgyrations of the Earth been never ſo ſwift at the Deluge, or had they been never ſo ſlow, or had they been none at all; ſtill the Months would have been the ſame that they were; and neither longer nor ſhorter. Tho then indeed they could not have conſiſted of ſo many <hi>days</hi> and <hi>nights,</hi> following each other in an orderly ſucceſſion; becauſe through want of the Earth's Diurnal motion, there would have been no ſuch viciſſitude of them.</p>
               <p>And ſince the Anſwerer took upon him to tell the Excepter what he had in his mind, as he ſuppoſed: the Replicant, in requital of his kindneſs, as well as in imitation of his Patern; may ſuggeſt to him what <hi>he</hi> ſhould have had in his thoughts. When he ſaid, <hi>if thirty days were to go to a Month, whether the days were longer or ſhorter, there must be thirty of them:</hi> he ſhould have conſidered, that theſe thirty days were to be of ſuch a length juſt, as that that Number of them might
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:51858:42"/> make a Solar Month. For ſuppoſing them either long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſhorter than ſo, they could not be ſuch days as the Scripture ſpeaks of; becauſe thirty of <hi>them</hi> ſtill made ſuch a Month. Whereas if they had been ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as there muſt have been more; ſo if they had been Longer, fewer would have done it. And thus the Anſwerer's deſign of throwing a <hi>Blunder</hi> upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter, is quite defeated: and while he made an awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Blow at <hi>him,</hi> he only ſtruck and wounded himſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet the Duſt he here raiſes, can neither hide the Objection which the Excepter made; nor yet ſo blind the Reader's eyes, as that he ſhould not ſee it remains unanſwered. For after all, if the Contiguity of the Sphaere of the Exterior Earth with the Abyſs, ceaſed; by reaſon the Waters of the Abyſs were exhaled: that Sphaere of the Earth muſt be carried about with leſs Celerity than before it was. Eſpecially if the Moon came late into the Earth's Neighbourhood; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an heavy Luggage in the outward part of the Earth's Vortex; like a Clog hang'd upon the Rim of a Wheel, would make it turn more ſlowly, as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter objected.</p>
               <p>But becauſe we have hinted, that Scripture gives us to underſtand, that there were twelve Months in the Antediluvian year, and thirty days in each of thoſe Months; it will not be amiſs to conclude this Chapter, with ſhowing how Scripture makes the things out. In the eighth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> then, and the fifth verſe, it informs us, that <hi>the waters decreaſed until the tenth Month.</hi> And after this, that <hi>at the end of forty days</hi> Noah <hi>opened the window of the ark, v.</hi> 6th. And that <hi>he ſtayed yet other ſeven days, and ſent forth the Dove, v.</hi> 10th. And that <hi>he ſtayed yet other ſeven days, and ſent forth the Dove</hi> again, <hi>v.</hi> 12th. Which <hi>fifty four</hi>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51858:43"/> days following the <hi>firſt</hi> day of the tenth Month, on which the tops of the Mountains were ſeen, <hi>v.</hi> 5th. ſhow that there muſt be <hi>twelve</hi> months in the year; and indeed they make them up ſo many, bating <hi>five</hi> days, which we muſt ſuppoſe were ſtill to run out, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Month of the next year came in, <hi>v.</hi> 13th. And then it ſhows that there were <hi>thirty days</hi> in each Month. For firſt we find <hi>twenty ſeven</hi> days in one Month in this Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 14th. And as we read in the Seventh Chapter, <hi>the Waters prevailed upon the Earth one hundred and fifty days, v.</hi> 24th. Yet they began to come in, <hi>the ſeventeenth day of the ſecond month,</hi> v. 11th. and they began to decreaſe by <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth day of the ſeventh month.</hi> Chap. 8th. <hi>v.</hi> 3d. Whence it is plain that the hundred and fifty days made juſt five months, during which the Waters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; and ſo every month muſt conſiſt of <hi>thirty</hi> days.</p>

               <p>And here the Anſwerer interrogates;<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>May not waters aſcend by force and detruſion; when it is the eaſieſt way they can take to free themſelves from that force, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in their motion?</hi> Without all Queſtion they may: provided <hi>that</hi> force and detruſion be of power ſufficient to compel them to aſcend, againſt the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their natural Gravity, and ſuch extrinſic acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Obſtacles, as may chance to lye in their way and hinder them. But what then? He goes on:<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>This is the caſe we are ſpeaking to. They were impell'd to aſcend, or recede from the Center, and it was eaſier for them to aſcend laterally, than to aſcend directly: upon an inclin'd Plain, than upon a perpendicular one.</hi> This aſſertion wants a great deal of Proof. For that the Waters of the Chaos,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51858:44"/> ſhould, through the Circumgyration of it, riſe or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend any way, is very improbable: as being bound down by the circumambient Air, which is carried about therewith. Fill a ſphaerical Glaſs with water, and then turn it ſwiftly upon its own Center. However the water in this Glaſs, may have a ſtrong and conſtant <hi>Conatus</hi> (during that its Motion) towards riſing up: yet certain it is, the Glaſs that contains it, would keep it from ſwelling out beyond thoſe Bounds to which it ſelf confines it. In like manner, the Body of the Air (in which at that time, was the whole matter of the Exterior Earth diffuſed, ſurrounding the entire Element of the Water; would have kept <hi>that</hi> from <hi>actual</hi> rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the Center; tho it were impregnated with a <hi>conatus</hi> that way. 'Tis confeſs'd, if we take a Globe and turn it round ſwiftly; Water, or Sand, if we lay either upon it, will fly off it violently. And one reaſon is, becauſe the ambient Air does not turn with this Globe: but gliding cloſe upon its wheeling Surface, by a renitency againſt it, ſweeps off whatever lies looſe upon it. But were the Air about it, carried round with it; the lighteſt things, that lye looſeſt on its Superficies, would reſt there unmoved; ſuppoſing it the proper Center of their Gravity. And for the ſame reaſon, fineſt Duſt lies undiſturb'd, even upon the tops of higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; tho they whisk about with ſuch celerity, as no humane Art and ſtrength can imitate. And if the Earth's Rotation, as rapid as it is, cannot cauſe ſmall Duſt to riſe from Hills, in way of receſſion from the Center: much leſs could it produce that great effect upon the Maſs of Water; which as it was a vaſt and ponderous Body, ſo it couched the cloſer to the Earth under it.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, as to a competent or ſufficient Cauſe of the Wate 's ſuppoſed <hi>Riſe</hi> or <hi>Aſcent;</hi> we are yet at a loſs. For the Cauſe aſſigned, is <hi>Detruſion;</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion

                  <hi>Methinks the Obſervator might have conceiv'd this Detruſion of waters towards the Poles, by the reſiſtance of the ſuperambient Air.</hi> But now if this Cauſe fail'd, and was not able to detrude the Waters at the <hi>Equinoctial,</hi> where they were to be thruſt down: Or, which is worſe, if it be ſound a more effectual Cauſe to detrude them at the <hi>Poles,</hi> where they were to riſe up: what then becomes of this <hi>Aſſertion</hi> we ore upon: or of that <hi>Eſſential</hi> of the Theory it relates to; the <hi>Oval form</hi> of the Primitive Earth? Yet in Reality thus it was. The Air that ſhould have depreſs'd or thruſt down the Waters, at the <hi>Aequator</hi> of the liquid Globe; was <hi>more diſpos'd</hi> to do it at its <hi>Polar</hi> parts. For the Sun moving always in the Equinoctial of that Globe; the Air there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts muſt needs be very hot; and ſo, very thin; and ſo, very yielding; and ſo, leſs able to reſiſt and detrude the Waters. And on the contrary, the Sun being always very diſtant from the Poles; the Air in thoſe parts muſt needs be more cold: and ſo, more thick, and ſo, more ſtiff and heavy; and ſo, more fit to make Reſiſtance and Detruſion there, than any where elſe. Yet ſee the unluckineſs of this contrivance: the Waters were to riſe higher there, much higher at the Poles, where the Air would moſt reſiſt them; and to be thruſt down loweſt at the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by the Air, where it could leaſt depreſs them. And if by the Air's <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> be meant any thing elſe, but a <hi>meer Detruſion</hi> ariſing from its <hi>natural weight</hi> (which, as is ſaid, had moſt force to keep the Waters down, where it was moſt needful they ſhould have riſen up) <hi>ſuch</hi> a Reſiſtance cannot be conceived; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that the whole Maſs of the Air was carried about in Circumgyration with the Globe of Water. The Deſerts of <hi>Biledulgerid, Lybia,</hi> &amp;c. lie betwixt
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51858:45"/> the Aequator and our Northern Tropic; and ſo within the compaſs of that Latitude, where the Waters of the liquid Globe, ſhould have felt a Reſiſtance of the Air. But what reaſon have we to believe they did ſo, when the light or running Sands there, are no more ruffled, or in the leaſt ſtirred by ſuch Reſiſtance; than if they were a cruſt of Flint or Adamant? and the like may by ſaid of <hi>Mare del Zur.</hi> It lies under the Line, and ſo in the Equinoctial part of this Terraqueous Globe. Which being there of the biggeſt Circumference, it muſt turn thereabouts moſt ſwiftly, and ſo cauſe the greater reſiſtance of the Air (were there any ſuch thing) and that would produce as great a diſturbance in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But on the contrary, ſo quiet, and ſtill, and ſmooth, and even, is this vaſt Ocean; that it is called the <hi>Pacific Sea.</hi> And if theſe ſpatious Waters, ſo exactly fitted for this Reſiſtance, both by their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and immenſely wide and far extended Surface; feel nothing of it now, why <hi>ſhould</hi> or how <hi>could</hi> the waters of the Abyſs do it at firſt? No, the Air reſiſted and detruded <hi>then,</hi> but as it does <hi>now:</hi> That is, ſo far as its own Gravity cauſed a Compreſſion. Which as it was gentle, ſo it was general; comparing the entire Globe at once with a ſoft conſtringency. Only there was reaſon (as we have ſhewed) why this compreſſion ſhould be lighteſt at the Equinoctial, and why it ſhould be heavieſt at the Poles of the Globe; and why it could not make ſuch <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> or <hi>Detruſion,</hi> as is imputed to the Air. In ſhort. If it did make <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;</hi> either it was gentle, and would only have rim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled the Surface of the turning Waters (as the <hi>Subſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> does, which blows conſtantly about the Equator) and ſo would not have been of force ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them into an oval Figure: or elſe it was violent; and ſo would have diſcompos'd the Abyſs ſo much,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51858:45"/> that the Earth could never have been founded upon it. And truly what leſs than ſuch a violence as would ſo have diſcompos'd it, could alter the Figure of it?</p>
               <p>But yet that there neither was, nor could be ſuch a violent reſiſtance made by the Air, as to detrude the Waters of the Chaotic Maſs; may, I think be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from the Motion of the Moon. Her Diſtance from hence in her Perigee, or neareſt approach to us, is about 51 Semidiameters of the Earth: in her Apogee, or fartheſt remove from us, about 65. To take a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate or middling Diſtance therefore betwixt both, let us ſuppoſe her always 56 of thoſe Semidiameters off us. And then let us ſuppoſe again, that ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms her Periodical Circuit in 28 Days; tho ſhe does it in leſs. Now ſhe abſolving her Circuit at 56 Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters diſtance from the Earth, in 28 Days; in caſe She were but 28 Semidiameters diſtant, which is but half the Space; ſhe muſt do it in 14 Days, which is but half the time. And ſo were ſhe diſtant but 14 Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters; ſhe muſt do it conſequently in 7 Days. According to which proportion, the Air towards the Earth, at the heighth of one Semidiameter above it, muſt wheel about as faſt as the Earth it ſelf does, to the ſpace of half a Day. Now every Semidiameter of the Earth containing, ſays Mr. <hi>Rohault (Tract. Phyſ. par.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 12.) near 1431 Leagues; or 4293 <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miles: hence it will follow, that the Air at the heighth of 2146 Miles, turns about as faſt as the Earth, bating but 6 Hours. And at the heighth of 1073 Miles, as faſt as that, bating 3 Hours. And ſo at the heighth of 357 Miles (to avoid fractions) to one Hour. Which divide into 60 parts, becauſe in an Hour there are 60 Minutes; and the Air at the heighth of 6 Miles, muſt turn as faſt as the Earth (in round reckoning) to the ſpace of one Minute. And (if we drive down the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51858:46"/> ſo low) at 3 quarters of a Miles heighth, it muſt turn as faſt, to the eighth part of a Minute. And ſo juſt on its Surface, <hi>even</hi> with it. And when the Air encompaſſing the Earth, does thus conſpire and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with it in its Gyration; how could it poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Waters of the turning Abyſs, ſo as to change their figure, from Sphaerical, to Oval?</p>
               <p>Nor will the Anſwerer's <hi>Simile</hi> help here, unleſs it be to aggravate the thing againſt himſelf. He thinks this Detruſion of the Waters may be conceived,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>39.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>as well as their flowing towards and upon the Shores, by the preſſure of the Air under the Moon.</hi> And ſo indeed it may, by thoſe that can conceive the Air alone to be as heavy in it ſelf; as that and the Moon are both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But who in reaſon can conceive this?</p>
               <p>And to ſay it was <hi>eaſier</hi> for waters to aſcend <hi>laterally,</hi> than <hi>directly;</hi> to aſcend upon an <hi>inclin'd</hi> Plain, than a <hi>perpendicular</hi> one: is vain in this caſe. For what real <hi>Inclination</hi> could there be on a Globe, towards the Poles, more than at the Equator; every point of whoſe Superficies is Equidiſtant from the Center? And how could the Aſcent of Waters at the Poles of a Globe, be other than Direct and perpendicular; when its Polar parts are always as much a Plain, as its Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial ones can poſſibly be? So that to ſuppoſe waters could aſcend more eaſily at the Poles, than at the Aequator of the Chaotic Abyſs; is in effect to ſuppoſe, that they could aſcend perpendicularly more eaſily than they could aſcend perpendicularly. For at the Poles they were to aſcend as directly as at the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial; (the waters being exactly <hi>globular</hi> at firſt, till by this ſuppoſed aſcent they grew <hi>oval.</hi>) Only there they muſt have met with theſe two Diſadvantages, which at the Equinoctial they were free from. Firſt, (as we have hinted already) a more cold, and thick
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51858:46"/> and ſtark Air. Which we may be ſure would crowd them down at the Poles; becauſe an Air more warm, and fine, and ſoft, and open, is preſum'd to do it at the Aequator. Secondly, a weaker Spring or power to impel them. For in the Middle of the turning Globe, there was a <hi>Conatus</hi> or tendency of the Waters towards receding from the Center; but at the Sides of it, none at all. So that at the ſides they were to riſe, by that <hi>Conatus</hi> or Nitency in the Middle. And if a thin and open Air could prevail againſt that force, in its direct and primary efforts at the Aequinoctial; how much more would a thicker, cloſer Air have overpowred it, where it could be exerted but obliquely, remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and as it were at ſecond hand: at the Poles of the Abyſs?</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid, it will follow; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a better Defence of this <hi>Vital Aſſertion</hi> of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory, its whole Hypotheſis will fall to the Ground, for want of an <hi>Oval</hi> Earth to ſupport it. And whereas the Anſwerer in the Cloſe of his 14th. Chapter, makes this Reflection. <hi>Some men, they ſay, though of no great valour, yet will fight excellently well behind a Wall:</hi> So <hi>the Excepter, behind a Text of Scripture, is very fierce and rugged:</hi> He may pleaſe to take notice, that (tho it be much better fighting <hi>behind</hi> the Wall of a Text, than <hi>against</hi> it) the Excepter is here behind no ſuch Wall: but ingages him in the open field of Reaſon and Philoſophy, and doubts not but to keep his Poſt. That is, if he does not run to his <hi>Firſt Expedient</hi> (as his wont is) and turn the great Artillery of <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Providence</hi> upon him, before which there is no ſtanding. For that mows down the beſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and makes a Lane through them; as Chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot does through a Company of the braveſt Souldiers, tho they fight never ſo well, and have all imaginable
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51858:47"/> Right on their ſide. But then he muſt deſert his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis again (as he has often done;) and the World knows what he is that runs from his Colours: One, <hi>they ſay, of no great Valour.</hi> But truly if it be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of reproach to a man, to fight <hi>behind a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;</hi> the Excepter deſires that it may always ſtick cloſe to him. To adhere to the divine and holy Word, and to oppoſe error by revealed truth; he thinks is far enough from Cowardiſe. Bleſſed be GOD that we have ſuch a wall as His Scripture is, behind which, to fight againſt Truth's Enemies.</p>
               <p>Yet in this very Inſtance of forming an Oval Earth, he flies to the help of <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> and thereby turns this neceſſary and indiſpenſable Notion of the <hi>Air's</hi> reſiſtance or <hi>detruſion,</hi> quite out of doors. I mean by a certain Dilemma of his own, brought in in the ſecond Page of his Anſwer. I apply it to him in his own words. <hi>Either you take the Hypotheſis of an ordinary Providence, or of an extraordinary, as to the time allowed for the Formation of the Earth. If you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to an <hi>ordinary</hi> Providence, the formation of the Earth would require <hi>much more time than ſix days.</hi>
                  </hi> And ſo you muſt not take that Hypotheſis, becauſe as you your ſelf own, in the fifth page of your Anſwer, <hi>Scripture tell us</hi> that the Earth <hi>was form'd the third day. But if according to an <hi>extraordinary,</hi> you may ſuppoſe it made in ſix minutes.</hi> But then the <hi>Reſiſtance</hi> or <hi>Detruſion</hi> of the Air, could not make the Waters <hi>oval,</hi> that the Earth might be ſo. For <hi>that</hi> being an <hi>ordinary, natural</hi> Cauſe (ſuppoſing it could be a cauſe) would have required <hi>much more time than ſix days,</hi> for the production of ſuch an Effect. And conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this <hi>Reſiſtance,</hi> or <hi>Detruſion,</hi> is made vain here and utterly uſeleſs by your ſelf.</p>
               <p>But if againſt the Anſwerer's conceſſion of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51858:47"/> or miraculous efficiency here, we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an oval Earth to be made in a <hi>natural</hi> way; and that in order thereunto a globular Abyſs were to be form'd into an oval figure: yet how could this be done according to the rule or method of the Theory? For if the Waters of the Chaos, by receding from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did riſe up at the Equinoctial part of it, and above fall off towards the Poles: then underneath there muſt be a draught of Waters back again from the Poles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Equinoctial; which continuing to riſe there, might puſh or drive on the ſtream towards the Poles, that otherwiſe would not hold on its motion; foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it flowed on a true Globe, the ſurface of which is equivalent to a Plain, where Waters never flow but by force or impulſe. And yet if ſuch counter-motions as theſe be allowed to thoſe Waters, they might thus flow and reflow for ever, without producing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd effect. For the draught of Waters below to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Equinoctial, would draw in the liquid Maſs at the Poles, and ſo hinder its growing into an oblong or oval figure; as much as the Drift of them above to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Poles could ſwell them out there, and ſo help towards the ſame.</p>
               <p>The firſt Argument againſt the Oval Figure of the Earth, was its inconvenient <hi>Poſition,</hi> which would have followed thereupon. For then it muſt have lain <hi>croſs</hi> the vehicular Stream, by which it was carried round the Sun; and have been directed not unlike to Ships ſailing ſide-ways: and ſo it could not have kept that Poſition long, but muſt have chang'd its Site in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the duct or tendency of that Current wherein it ſwam. In anſwer to this it is ſuggeſted; that ſuch a poſture as lying <hi>croſs the Stream,</hi> would <hi>be more likely to effect</hi> the Earth's turning upon its own axis, as it does. <hi>And the Stream would take more hold
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51858:48"/> of an oblong Body, than of a round. (Anſw. p.</hi> 40.) And becauſe it would <hi>take more hold</hi> of it, for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it would the ſooner turn it out of its Poſition. For what makes the force of a ſtream, turn a long Body that lies croſs it; ſooner than another as long, which already lies length-ways in it; but only its taking more hold of it? And then as to the Earth's <hi>turning upon its own axis,</hi> it would rather have promoted than prevented the change of its ſituation; conſidering its <hi>wallowings</hi> in its Annual Circuit. For where a Body has two Motions upon the ſame Center, if one of them chances to be irregular; the other commonly diſorders it farther, rather than helps to correct its Exorbitance. Somewhat like a Bowl, which being not ſet out of hand right; the oftner it turns round in its progreſſive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the farther it runs on in a wrong Courſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument againſt the Oval Figure of the firſt Earth,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>196.</hi>
                  </note> is the <hi>Sphaericalneſs</hi> of the preſent Earth. And that the preſent Earth is Sphaerical, is not only the Opinion of Modern, but alſo of Ancient Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, ſaid the Excepter; and he named ſome. But <hi>the Theoriſt,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>40.</hi>
                  </note> ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>alledg'd <hi>many more</hi> Authorities in favour of the Oval Figure of the Earth. For beſides</hi> Empedocles <hi>in particular,</hi> he affirms <hi>that the Philoſophy of</hi> Orpheus, <hi>the</hi> Phoenician, Aegyptian, <hi>and</hi> Perſian <hi>Philoſophers, did all compare the Earth to an Egg, with reſpect to its Oval External Form.</hi> Here we muſt reply,<note place="margin">Another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</note> 1ſt, That this is another very <hi>falſe Aſſertion.</hi> For thoſe Philoſophers made the compariſon betwixt the <hi>World</hi> and the Egg, not betwixt the <hi>Earth</hi> and the Egg (tho our Author would put that ſenſe upon them.) Only two of the Authorities cited by him,<note place="margin">Lat. Theor. Edit. <hi>2.</hi> p. <hi>267.</hi>
                  </note> reſemble the Earth to the <hi>Yolk</hi> of the Egg very unluckily; for <hi>that,</hi> we know, is of a <hi>round</hi> Figure. 2ly, Where the Ancients compare the World to an Egg, they do it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51858:48"/> uſually with reſpect to its <hi>Production,</hi> as well as to its <hi>Form.</hi> A Notion which the Anſwerer, or any Theiſt, would be loth to admit of; that Heaven, and Earth, and all things therein, ſhould ſpring out of a material Egg.

                  </note>The <hi>Sphaericalneſs</hi> of this preſent Earth was argued; Firſt, from the <hi>Conical</hi> Figure of its ſhadow caſt upon the Moon.<note place="margin">Anſw p. <hi>41.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>But that,</hi> ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>cannot make a Difference, ſenſible to us at this diſtance, whether the Body that caſt the ſhadow was exactly Sphaerical or Oval.</hi> This is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and ſpoken againſt a common and approved Argument; and ſo of little weight.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was inferred from the place of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Which are deepeſt, ſo far as we know, near the Poles: whereas were the Earth Oval, the middle Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions thereof being loweſt, the Waters would have run thither, and ſettled under the Aequator. <hi>But this,</hi> he tells us, <hi>has been anſwer'd before.

               <p>Thirdly, It was urged, That if this Earth was Oval, Navigation towards the Poles would be extremely difficult, if not impoſſible, becauſe of Sailing up an Aſcent. <hi>But,</hi> ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>If there be a continual draught of Waters from the Aequator towards the Poles, this will Ballance the Difficulty.</hi> But if there be <hi>no ſuch draught,</hi> the difficulty holds: and that there is ſuch a Draught, remains to be proved.</p>
               <p>That the Figure of this Earth is truly Sphaerical, is fairly diſcovered and determin'd by this Obſervation. That the Gibboſity of the Sea riſes as faſt behind a Ship Sailing in direct <hi>Latitude,</hi> towards the Poles: as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind one whoſe courſe lies in direct <hi>Longitude,</hi> towards Eaſt or Weſt.</p>

For a larger Chaos would have contained more matter; and more matter would have made her Dimenſions bigger. But if the Chaos out of which the Moon was made, was forty times leſs than that out of which the Earth aroſe; then its central Earth, together with its Abyſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Orb, muſt be ſo much leſs than the ſame parts of the Earth reſpectively were, as being made of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients which were forty times leſs than theirs. And ſo the Orb of the Moon could not poſſibly be thicker than the Orb of the Earth; nor could its Mountains be higher than the Earths Mountains are, much leſs above <hi>four</hi> times higher, upon that account. And then as to the <hi>falling of its Ruines,</hi> if we allow it to have been done with all imaginable Advantages; which way could they have pil'd themſelves up ſo much high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the ruines of the Earth?

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51858:51"/> was alſo of a more pliant yielding nature, and ſo more apt and eaſie to aſcend. Laſtly, The Pores of this Earth being then cloſe ſhut; and the vehement Vapours rarefy'd within, having no other poſſible way to get out, but by elevating the Ground which lay upon them, and ſo confin'd and kept them down: no wonder if they threw it up with a mighty Force, and made it riſe into many and prodigious inequalities. And theſe things are here mention'd the rather, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a full anſwer to a Queſtion that is put. Namely, <hi>why we have no Mountains made now.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>48.</hi>
                  </note> It might as well have been askt, Why does not the Fire make a <hi>down-bak'd</hi> Loaf ſwell and huff up; becauſe it made it do ſo when it was <hi>Dough?</hi> But <hi>then</hi> it was a ſoft and puffy Maſs; whereas <hi>ſince,</hi> it is hardned; and the ſtrength of that Leaven, which was put into it, is wholly ſpent. And ſuch is the changed State of the Earth. It is dried and hardned very much over what it was: and its Original fermentive flatulent Principle, deſigned to aſſiſt in blowing it up, is quite exhauſted. And tho GOD himſelf did cooperate with the Sun, in the production of Mountains; yet ſtill this Anſwer muſt be fully ſatisfactory, as to the Queſtion propounded. For when ſubject matter grows indiſpos'd, or ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cauſes flagg and fail: the firſt and great Cauſe moſt <hi>commonly</hi> ſtops, and ceaſes to act. GOD <hi>ordinarily</hi> limits his Almighty Power by the Creatures Capacity. And where he is pleas'd to make uſe of means, if thoſe be wanting, he does nothing of himſelf; as being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of their concomitant Cauſality. And if He did not thus deſiſt from acting, He muſt violate the Laws which he has given to Nature; and invert or diſſolve that fixt Regularity, or methodical Order, that His Wiſdom has appointed and eſtabliſht in the Univerſe. Thus, He gives us Fruits, but Plants bear them: He
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51858:52"/> gives us Plants, but Rains nouriſh them: He gives us Rains, but Clouds disburſe them: and thoſe Clouds ariſe from Vapours; and thoſe Vapours are exhal'd from the Earth; and that Exhalation is perform'd by the Sun. So that take but one Cauſe out of this whole Series of them, and this orderly train of Effects would ceaſe, notwithſtanding the Power of ALMIGHTY GOD; as depending ſecondarily upon the entireneſs of this chain of Cauſes, the agency of which muſt needs be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended or finally ſtopt, upon the disjunction or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their effective connexion or concatenation. Thus alſo he gives Sight to Animals, but it is by their Eyes; He gives them hearing, but it is by their Ears: and if their Organs fail, their Senſes muſt do ſo. In like manner he thought ſit to give Mountains to the Earth; but then it was by imparting ſuch an Habit to it, or by conferring ſuch Qualities upon it, as might prepare and diſpoſe it towards their Production. And thoſe Qualities being perfectly altered; and that Habit decayed or deſtroyed: we are not now to expect that more Mountains ſhould be raiſed. And tho we never ſuppos'd the Sun could make them alone; yet we hope it will be granted that GOD and the Sun could eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it. That They could raiſe the vaſteſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of all, in the Northern parts of the Earth: Yea, even mighty <hi>Taurus</hi> it ſelf. As in making Rivers, the <hi>Anſwer</hi> ſays (p. 15.) the Waters were <hi>accelerated by a divine hand;</hi> ſo in raiſing Mountains the Sun might be aſſiſted by the ſame. But for the Excepter to have ſuppoſed that that, and other Mountains, were drawn up by the <hi>ſole</hi> power of the Sun; would have been to run himſelf under the Dint of his own Invective againſt <hi>abuſing</hi> Philoſophy,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>34.</hi> &amp;c.</note> by <hi>ſcrewing it too high.</hi>
               </p>

And however the <hi>Earlieſt,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Maritime</hi> Mountains, and ſuch as were made with the <hi>Hollow</hi> of the Sea, muſt riſe when that was ſunk or depreſſed; yet touching the <hi>Inland</hi> ones, in raiſing which the Sun was cencern'd: he ſaid, as plainly as he could ſpeak, that in ſome Countries they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <hi>earlier,</hi> and in ſome <hi>later.</hi>

                  </note> For ſtill we ſtand the ground of our Conjecture, and are like to abide unmoved by it.

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.12.</note> after the Waters were drained off it: that is by a ſpecial Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51858:53"/> and Divine aſſiſtance. And ſo he might cauſe thoſe Trees again to bring forth Fruits; and thoſe Fruits to ripen by that time <hi>Adam</hi> was created; that ſo they might be in a readineſs for his nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And here it may be remembred that what the Excepter ſaid in this matter, as to GOD's producing the Mountains by the inſtrumentality of the Sun; was but to <hi>humour Philoſophy (Diſc. p.</hi> 208.) and was meerly <hi>conjectural: I will <hi>venture</hi> to <hi>gueſs</hi> he might do it thus.

               <p>The laſt argument to prove that there were Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the Firſt World,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>215.</hi>

                  </note>To the Firſt Inſtance it is anſwered. That <hi>Scripture</hi> does not mention <hi>Iron Tools</hi> in Building the Ark, but only <hi>Gopher Wood</hi> and <hi>Pitch:</hi> and therefore <hi>'tis a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51858:53"/> rather; that there were no other Materials us'd.</hi> Had the Theoriſt kept cloſe to holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated his Principles and Hypotheſis by that; none of this Controverſie or Diſpute had happened.

As if it were a Fate on him, for deſerting it ſo much in <hi>other</hi> Caſes, and going againſt it. If he can preſume that the Ark was made of <hi>Gopher Wood</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> only, becauſe Scripture <hi>mentions</hi> nothing elſe: why could he not admit of a <hi>Sea</hi> as well, which the Scripture mentions every whit as expreſly? Or if Scripture's <hi>Silence</hi> concerning Things, be a ground of <hi>Preſumption</hi> that they were not; what then ſhall we think of an Oval and unmountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Earth, an incloſed Abyſs, a Paradiſiacal World, and the like; which the Scripture makes <hi>no</hi> mention of? Surely <hi>'tis a preſumption rather</hi> that there were no ſuch things. But not to digreſs. What kind of Fabrick the Ark was, the H. GHOST informs us.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.15, 6.</note> Three hundred Cubits long, fifty broad, and thirty high. Made with three Stories; divided into Rooms; and having a Window above, and a Door on its Side. Now it being ſo great a Veſſel, it could not be made but of very ſtrong and ſubſtantial Timber. Eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the uſe or ſervice whereunto it was appointed. For beſides Mankind, ſeven clean Beaſts, and as many Fowls, and two unclean of every ſort, were to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alive in it, and that for above the ſpace of a whole Year. And ſo it was to hold their food like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as well as themſelves; and to carry them all, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on deep, and ſpatious, and boundleſs Waters. And it being neceſſary upon theſe accounts, that it ſhould be fram'd of ſtrong Timber; in caſe it was done <hi>without</hi> Iron Tools, what can be thought, but that <hi>Noah</hi> and his Sons muſt pluck up well grown Trees by the Roots;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51858:54"/> and then whole, and round, and rough as they were, faſten them together with ſtore of Pitch? But how all the pains and art in the World, could make this Ark of due form and ſtrength, in ſuch a Method, and of ſuch Materials; who can imagine, beſides our Anſwerer? Doubtleſs <hi>Noah</hi> had a ſingular knack at Ark-making, that he could raiſe ſuch a Structure all out of whole Trees; and when he had plac'd them in their order, could ſix them in it, meerly by Pitching them <hi>within and without.</hi>

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.14.</note> And ſo well did he fix them, that neither the fall of the Earth, nor the fury of the Flood, could move them one jot.

                  <hi>No Sea was ever ſo tumultuous as this, nor is there any thing in preſent Nature to be compar'd with the diſorder of theſe Waters; All the Poetry, and all Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perboles that are us'd in the deſcription of Storms and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Seas, were literally true in this, if not beneath it: The Ark was really carry'd to the tops of higheſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and into the places of the Clouds, and thrown down again into the deepeſt Gulfs.</hi> Brave Ark! and as bravely built; that could endure all this, and yet never ſpring ſo much as one Tree. What would our Merchants give, I'll warrant you, for Ships of ſuch Gopher Wood and Pitch? But alas! this ſtrong way of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was calculated only for the Deluge. The Myſtery of doing it leſt the World together with the Equinox: and never ſince the Earth has ſtood awry, could Men lay Trees ſo well in Pitch.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the Second Inſtance it is ſuppoſed; that the City built by <hi>Cain,</hi>

                  </note> 
                  <hi>was a number of Cottages, made of branches of Trees, of Oſiers, and Bulruſhes; and what needed they any other houſes, when the Air was ſo temperate?</hi> But Firſt, This Suppoſition is bottom'd upon a falſe Foundation. For they who conceive the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51858:54"/> City <hi>Enochia</hi> to be ſo mean; commonly think it was ſo for want of <hi>Workmen,</hi> not for lack of <hi>Tools</hi> to build it. But <hi>that</hi> being not built till after the death of <hi>Abel;</hi> and <hi>he</hi> being not ſlain before the hundred and twenty ninth year of <hi>Adam;</hi> by that time there might be Myriads of men upon the Earth;<note place="margin">Poterant illo ſpatio non cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And therefore <hi>Cain</hi>'s City need not be ſuppoſed to conſiſt of ſuch Cottages; becauſe there was a ſcarcity of good Artificers. Secondly, To ſay <hi>the Air was ſo temperate</hi> then, as that there <hi>needed</hi> no other than Oſier Cottages; is to take that for determin'd, which is under debate. And beſides, houſes are rear'd for other uſes, as well as for Defenſatives againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate Air. And in Cities commonly they are beſt and moſt ſumptuous. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Ad ſui defenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem, quia ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per erat in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more &amp; tremore poſitus. <hi>Lyr. in</hi> Gen. <hi>4.17.</hi>
                  </note> It is thought that <hi>Cain</hi> built this City for his own ſafety. Being full of guilt, and ſo of fear; he was for dwelling in a ſtrong place. But what fortifications were Mud-walls and Oſiers capable of? Such a Fortreſs could yield but a little ſatisfaction to his mind, as being a poor defence or ſecurity to his Perſon. Fourthly, If <hi>Henochia</hi> did not outſtand the Flood, we are better aſſured that <hi>Joppa</hi> did. And then, we hope, it muſt be built of ſuch Materials, as could not be fitted and made into Aedifices, without the help of Iron Tools.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is urged, that the Excepter ſays, that the <hi>Indians</hi> had no Inſtruments of Iron, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came amongſt them: That's very true.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>50.</hi>
                  </note> But then they built no ſuch Ark as <hi>Noah</hi>'s was; nor had they any <hi>Tubals,</hi> Maſter-Black-ſmiths, Braziers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Country. Nor were there <hi>ſuch</hi> Cities found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as we have reaſon to believe were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in good plenty before the Deluge.

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51858:55"/> Si quis mente concipere velit, qualis ante diluvium ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum ſacies ſuerit, is ſibi totidem poſt diluvium ſecula proponat, &amp; inde, de praeteritis conjecturam faciat. <hi>If any one would conceive in his mind, what kind of face the Earth had before the Flood, let him cast with himſelf how it was ſo many ages after the Flood, and from thence gueſs concerning thoſe that are paſt.</hi> And ſo there muſt be as many Cities in the World, at the time of the Flood, as there was ſince the flood, about the time of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar:</hi> it being as long from the Deluge to his time; as it was from the Creation to the Deluge. And tho he takes notice, that no Cities are remembred by Writers, but <hi>Henoch,</hi> by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and <hi>Joppa</hi> by profane Authors; yet he puts the Queſtion, Quis dubitet adeò jam aucto genere humano, plurimas regiones, imò to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam penè <hi>Aſiam</hi> &amp; <hi>Egyptum,</hi> Urbibus, oppidis, pagis, ante diluvium ſuiſſe exornatas. <hi>Who can doubt, that very many countries, yea, almoſt all</hi> Aſia <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>were garniſhed with Cities, Towns, and Villages, before the flood; mankind being ſo increaſed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his Queſtions, how the Children of <hi>Cain</hi> came to <hi>find out</hi> Iron;<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>50.</hi>
                  </note> and then to know the <hi>Nature and uſe</hi> of it; and then the way of <hi>preparing and tempering</hi> it: I think we may reply; that in this matter they had inſtructions from <hi>Adam,</hi> as he had his knowledge from GOD. Or if we ſhould ſay, they underſtood this by Inſpiration, it would be no raſh or extravagant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. For why might not ſome of <hi>Cain</hi>'s Children be inſpired to find out Braſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as <hi>Aholiab</hi> was inſpired to work in it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.3, 5.? And yet they might find out Iron, and other Metals in a lower way than that. For the Flaming Sword at the Eaſt of <hi>Eden,</hi> might be a <hi>burning</hi> of the Earth (<hi>Diſcourſe p.</hi> 270.) And that it could not be the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> (as the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry allows it to have been) two Reaſons were given
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51858:55"/> (<hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 272.) Tho neither is anſwered but by the <hi>Laſt Expedient.</hi> Now the Earth being once fired, and burning continually; at length it might reach to ſome Mine below, and melting the Metal, cauſe it to run, and boil up upon the Ground. And then obſervation and wiſe experience, could not but lead men into a ſpeedy acquaintance with its Nature and Uſe: And alſo make the firſt Iron that they had, inſtrumental in helping them to procure more. Thus (according to <hi>Herodotus, lib.</hi> 7. and <hi>Natalis Comes, lib.</hi> 9.) the <hi>Idaei Dactyli</hi> (the ſame with the <hi>Curetes</hi> or <hi>Corybantes</hi>) both found out Iron, and learnt the Art of uſing it; by the burning of <hi>Ida.</hi> And why then might not the Progeny of <hi>Cain,</hi> both get Iron, and skill in it, the ſame way? But however they came by Iron, or by skill to uſe it, and make Tools of it; 'tis certain that they had it, and that's enough for us. And truly if they had not made <hi>Tools</hi> of it alſo, <hi>Jubal</hi> could no more have attain'd to his <hi>Art;</hi> than his Brother <hi>Tubal</hi> could have taught his <hi>Trade. Jubal</hi> was <hi>the Father of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ, Gen.</hi> 4.21. And how could ſuch Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments be made without Iron Tools? But now I think on't, there might be <hi>Gopher Wood</hi> and <hi>Pitch</hi> as well in <hi>Jubal</hi>'s time, as there was in <hi>Noah</hi>'s: and they might ſerve as well to make the Harp and Organ of the one; as they did to make the Ark of the other, without Tools of Iron. Yet then the miſchief on't is, <hi>Scripture does not mention either:</hi> and therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Anſwerer's Rule above, <hi>'tis a preſumption ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that there were no ſuch Materials uſ'd upon thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</hi> But then 'tis a preſumption withal, that no ſuch Harp or Organ were made. And another as ſhrewd a preſumption will follow: that <hi>Jubal</hi> was a Father without Children. Or if you will, that he could not poſſibly be a Father of Muſick himſelf, becauſe he
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51858:56"/> wanted Inſtruments whereon to learn: nor could he poſſibly beget any Sons of that Science, becauſe he had no Inſtruments whereby to teach.</p>
               <p>He anſwers the laſt inſtance thus. <hi>As to</hi> Tubal Cain, <hi>let thoſe that poſitively aſſert that there was no Iron in the firſt World, tell us in what ſenſe that place is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. I believe Iron or Braſs is not once mention'd in all the Theory.</hi> But why ſo indirect an Anſwer? One would think that the Argument here, which conſiſts of Iron, were red-hot, to ſee how he handles it. And the truth is, let him touch it never ſo Gingerly, it will all at once both burn his Fingers, and Brand his Hypotheſis. <hi>Iron or Braſs is not once mention'd in all the Theory.</hi> Very good: Yet for all that, the Theoriſt flatly denies the being of them <hi>both,</hi> before the Flood. The Clauſe fore-cited witneſſeth as much. <hi>Metals <hi>and Minerals, I believe they had</hi> none <hi>in the firſt Earth.</hi>
                  </hi> And if they had <hi>no Metals,</hi> for certain they had <hi>no Iron</hi> nor <hi>Braſs.</hi> He adds; <hi>the happier they; no Gold, nor Silver, nor <hi>courſer Metals.</hi>
                  </hi> If therefore Iron and Braſs, be <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Metals</hi> than Gold and Silver; he excludes <hi>them</hi> out of the firſt World, as much as he does the finer ones named. Nor does he more abſolutely exclude them by his <hi>words;</hi> than he effectually barrs them out of the firſt State of Nature, by the <hi>tenour</hi> of his Hypotheſis. For that lodges the Abyſs betwixt the Central and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Earth, and ſo renders their Aſcent from below, into the ſuperior Terreſtial Region, quite impoſſible.

               <head>CHAP. XI.</head>
               <p>THat there was an <hi>Open Sea</hi> before the Flood, the Excepter proved by <hi>Scripture</hi> and by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> in his Eleventh Chapter. But the Anſwerer inverts the Order of that Chapter, and thinks fit to begin with the laſt firſt. As if he deſigned by altering the Method, to perplex the Matter, and pervert the Arguments. Or at leaſt to raiſe ſuch a Miſt of Confuſion, as might dim the Eye of the Reader's Obſervation, and partly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the Weakneſs of his Anſwer. But let us follow him in his own way, and not fear in the leaſt, but 'twill be every whit as eaſy for us. For indeed let him go even which way he pleaſes, we are bound in Juſtice to give him this Commendation; that he never leads us into any difficulties.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Reaſon</hi> offered in proof of an Open Sea, was this. Becauſe otherwiſe the ſubterraneous Abyſs muſt have been the Receptacle for Fiſhes,<note place="margin">Dſc. p. <hi>224.</hi>
                  </note> or <hi>the only place of their abode.</hi> And <hi>that Abyſs could by no means have been a fit Dwelling for them,</hi> upon Three Accounts: As being too <hi>Dark,</hi> too <hi>Cloſe,</hi> and too <hi>Cold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Anſwerer would perſwade us to believe otherwiſe. <hi>As for <hi>Coldneſs,</hi> methinks,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he might have left that out,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>51.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>unleſs he ſuppoſes that there are no Fiſh in the frozen Seas, towards the North and South; which is againſt all ſenſe and experience: for Cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys abound moſt in Fiſh.</hi> But are there any where any frozen Seas, on which the Sun never ſhin'd for ſixteen hundred years together? He muſt ſhow us <hi>ſuch</hi> Seas,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51858:57"/> if he would bring his Anſwer home to the Objection. For in whatſoever Seas Fiſhes do breed, thoſe Seas muſt certainly at times, feel a great deal of Warmth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from the Sun: elſe theſe Creatures, ſo cold of themſelves, could never Multiply. And therefore, we ſee, that even in <hi>our</hi> Seas, they breed not in <hi>Winter,</hi> for want of the Sun. And if the Sun's Declination or withdrawment from us, hinders their Production in our Seas (and Rivers) as ſenſe and experience ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently teſtifie; his <hi>total</hi> Abſence and conſtant Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, would put a final ſtop to their Procreation. Yet ſuch was his Abſence, and ſuch his Excluſion from the inclos'd Abyſs. It may be made a Queſtion, whether Fiſhes can live and breed in a Deep Well, which is open; by reaſon of its Coldneſs. And if they cannot, how much leſs in the Abyſs? which being cloſe, and much Deeper; was anſwerably colder. In caſe it be objected, that in ſuch a Well they would lack Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Objection turns much more forcibly upon the Abyſs. For whereas the ſmaller Sorts of Fiſh live on Flies and Worms; where ſhould they have found them ſo far under ground? And yet neceſſary it was that the leſſer Kinds of Fiſh ſhould exiſt; that ſo they might be food, and ſuſtenance for the Greater.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and <hi>Cloſeneſs;</hi> he oppoſes to them <hi>the Saying of</hi> Maimonides,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>51.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That no man ever would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a Child could live ſo many months, ſhut up in its Mothers Belly, if he had never ſeen the experience of it.</hi> For, ſays the Anſwerer, <hi>there's Cloſeneſs and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the higheſt degree: and in Animals, that, as ſoon as born, cannot live without Reſpiration.</hi> But ſurely the Difference betwixt Children in the Womb, and Fiſhes in the Abyſs; is very great. For 1ſt. Children unborn, are imperfect; (and ſo indeed they are, when new born, and long after; (they may be perfect in
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51858:57"/> Shape, but they are imperfect in ſtrength:) But with Fiſhes in the Abyſs, it could not be ſo. Secondly, Children in the Womb, have no local Motion; which to Fiſhes in the Abyſs, muſt be allowed. Thirdly, Children in the womb, are ſupply'd with ſutable and ſufficient Nouriſhment, by eaſy and natural Derivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their Mothers: But Fiſhes in the Abyſs, were to ſeek out for theirs, and to get it when, and where they could find it. Fourthly, Fiſhes in the Abyſs, were to propagate there; (A ſure Indication of their true Perfection in that State:) But Children unborn, were far enough from doing that. Laſtly, That great Body of water, being cloſe ſhut up, and always qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcent, and having no way to purge and clarify it ſelf; would have putrified, and poyſoned all the Fiſh; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if it inclin'd to any degree of warmth, as the Anſwerer here ſurmiſes: <hi>There would he more danger of too much warmth.</hi> But from this Inconvenience,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> in their vital Habitation (ſuppoſing it to continue in its natural State) Children in the Womb are free.</p>
               <p>And whereas he urges that Fiſhes <hi>Prey on the night time:</hi> That ſignifies nothing. For firſt,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our nights <hi>above</hi> the Earth; is not comparable to the Darkneſs a Mile <hi>under</hi> it. And Secondly, in very dark nights. 'tis like they prey only upon dead Baits; or upon ſuch living ones, as are ſet for them, and made ſo faſt that they cannot get away. And to his Objection, of <hi>Fiſhes living in ſubterraneous Lakes;</hi> the reply is as eaſy. For no ſubterraneous Lakes in which Fiſhes live; are ſo <hi>cloſe,</hi> and deep into the Earth; as this pretended ſubterraneous Abyſs.</p>
               <p>But farther; that there was an <hi>Open Sea</hi> in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeval World, the Excepter prov'd, againſt the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, from <hi>Scripture.</hi> And the firſt Argument,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 219, 220</note> was the <hi>Dominion</hi> which GOD gave unto <hi>Adam, over the Fiſh
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51858:58"/> of the Sea. Gen.</hi> 1.26, 28. But if there were not an <hi>open Sea,</hi> impoſſible it was, that he ſhould have or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe ſuch a Dominion as GOD ALMIGHTY gave him. Whereunto it is anſwered thus. Adam <hi>had <hi>no more</hi> Dominion given him over the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>52.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>than over the Fowls of the Air.</hi> And did the Excepter affirm that he had? Let it be granted that he had but as <hi>much;</hi> and our Buſineſs is done, and ſo is the Theoriſt's. This, the Gentleman knew very well; and therefore we ſee how ſhie he is of a direct Anſwer, and how aloof he ſtands in what he ſays. As for <hi>Adam</hi>'s Power over the <hi>Fowls,</hi> it was ſufficient; ſuch as ſhewed his Dominion to be real. For he exercis'd it <hi>thou,</hi> at leaſt as much as we do <hi>now.</hi> That is, he could take them in Fields, or Fens, or Heaths, or Rivers; and have them in good plenty about Him. But had he an equal power over the Fiſh, when they kept only in a ſubterraneous Pond; and that was wall'd round at ſuch a rate, that even through all his long life,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> he could not command ſo much as a Pair of Sprats? He adds, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fowls; that Adam <hi>could not come at them. or ſeize them at his pleaſure, unleſs he could fly into the Air after them.</hi> Very much to the purpoſe. As if he could have had no Dominion over the Fowls, without the uſe of Wings. And becauſe he had not a Power over the <hi>Fowls,</hi> above his capacity; and ſuch a Command as neither <hi>his</hi> Nature and Circumſtances, nor <hi>theirs</hi> would allow: therefore he had none at all over the <hi>Fiſh.</hi> Notably argu'd, and with mighty good Conſequence. <hi>Adam</hi> was not tall enough to ſtand upon the ground, and take the Weather-cock of a Church-ſteeple; and therefore, good man, he could not ſtand upon tip-toe neither. Becauſe he had not ſuch a Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Sea, as was impoſſible; therefore he could not have one of which he was capable. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51858:58"/> he muſt be akin to the Sages of <hi>Gotham,</hi> who argues that Man is not Lord of the Creatures, becauſe they could not hedge in the poor Cuckow; or drown the Eel as they might have done a Kitling.</p>
               <p>When a King makes a Gentleman, Lord-Lieutenant of a County; by virtue of his Commiſſion, is he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the ſtrongeſt man that is in it? Does it inable him to encounter whole Regiments of Souldiers in his ſingle Perſon; or to vanquiſh all the Militia under him, at once? Does it impower him to carry a Canon upon his Neck? Or when the great Gun is fir'd off, to catch the Bullet as it flies, and put it up in his Pocket? Can he not hold the place, and execute the Office of a Lord-Lieutenant, without ſuch preternatural and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous abilities? So when GOD gave <hi>Adam</hi> Dominion over the Fowls; did he mean that he ſhould dive like a Duck, or ſoar like a Falcon? That he ſhould ſwim as naturally as the Swan; and hunt the Kite, or Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, as Boys do the Wren? Did he mean that he ſhould hang up Oſtritches in a Cage, as people do Linnets? Or fetch down the Eagles to feed with his Pullen, and make them perch with his Chickens in the Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooſt? Or elſe could he have no command over the Fowls? And in like manner when he gave the ſame <hi>Adam</hi> Dominion over the Sea; was he to be able to dwell at the bottom, or to walk on the top of it? To drain it as a Ditch; or take all its Fry at once in a Drag-net? Was he to Snare the <hi>Shark</hi> as we do young <hi>Pickarels?</hi> Or to bridle the <hi>Sea-Horſe,</hi> and ride him for his Pad? Or to put a ſlip upon the <hi>Crocodiles</hi> Neck, and play with him as with a Dog? Or elſe muſt he have no Dominion over that Element, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in it? Certainly betwixt having Dominion over the Fowls, <hi>and flying after them in the Air;</hi> there is great difference. And ſo there is betwixt the real Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51858:59"/> which <hi>Adam</hi> had over the Sea, and its Fiſh; and all exceſs or extravagance of Rule.</p>
               <p>When GOD ſet <hi>Adam</hi> over the Fiſh of the Sea, he plac'd him under his Glorious SELF. For had his Dominion been ſupreme and abſolute, he muſt have partook of GOD's Nature; as well as he did of his Image, and Empire. But as we very well know, all Subordinate Power muſt be limited: and ſo was <hi>Adam</hi>'s. And therefore he could not go beyond his preſcribed Bounds; but was to command the Fiſh, as he did other Creatures. That is, according to the Order of the World, and the Laws of Providence; according to the Capacity of his own Nature, and the Quality of theirs. And if ſo be he did but act in his Station, in purſuance of his Commiſſion; governing his Subjects as in Duty he was obliged, and as in Power he was inabled; that is, according to the Will of GOD, and the meaſures of a Man: this will be ſufficient for <hi>him</hi> who <hi>had</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and ſo it will be for <hi>us</hi> who <hi>defend</hi> it.</p>
               <p>The Anſwerer proceeds; <hi>Adam was made Lord of all Animals upon the Earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 52<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>and had a right to uſe them for his conveniency, when they came into his power.</hi> Here he ſpeaks as out of a Cloud; and we may juſtly ſuſpect that what he ſays, had need be clear'd from doubtful meaning. For Fiſhes, if his Hypotheſis may be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, were never <hi>upon <hi>this Earth,</hi>
                  </hi> but always <hi>under it,</hi> during <hi>Adam</hi>'s time; and ſo they never <hi>came into his power</hi> neither. And therefore it may be queſtion'd, whether he means that <hi>Adam</hi> was Lord of <hi>them</hi> or not. But if in, <hi>all Animals,</hi> he includes the <hi>Fiſhes;</hi> then we reply as follows. That in caſe the Doctrine of the Theory be true, <hi>Adam</hi> could be but a poor and ſorry Lord over the Fiſhes; which are a conſiderable part of the living Creatures.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 32. <hi>C.</hi> 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> attempts, in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory,</hi> to reduce all of them, that belong to the Sea, to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51858:59"/> an hundred ſeventy and ſix kinds; and to particularize the ſeveral Names of them reſpectively. But ſo mean a Lord was <hi>Adam</hi> over them, that indeed to call him by this Title, in reference to thoſe Animals; would be but to put an affront upon him, he enjoying no more (if the Theoriſt errs not) than a meer colour or ſhadow of that honour. Should an Emperor grant one of his Courtiers a Commiſſion, to be his Vice-Roy, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, in a certain Country, which 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould ever come at; as this Patent would reproach the Majeſty that gives it, ſo would it not be Mockage to the Favourite that receives it? Yet juſt ſuch is the Caſe here. As impoſſible it was for <hi>Adam</hi> to come at the Abyſs below; as it was for him to dart downward, for a Mile or two's Thickneſs, through the compact and ſolid Earth. So that his Lordſhip over the Fiſhes there, muſt be a bare nominal and titular thing. And he might as well have been Lord over the Fiſh in the Moon (ſuppoſing ſhe had any) as over the Fiſh in the Infernal Sea. For his deſcent to the one, was as difficult, as his aſcent would have been to the other; and his Power was exercis'd alike in both: for he died above ſeven hundred years, before the <hi>Ocean,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>one Fiſh,</hi> appeared in the World. Now pray, when, or to whom? in what Ages, and to which of his Servants, did the GOD of Heaven ever aſſign ſuch mock Seigniories, and pitiful airy Royalties, as this? No, they are windy promiſes that convey empty Donatives; and <hi>neither</hi> can proceed from that Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Being, which is the fulneſs of Sincerity and all Munificence. Where GOD is pleas'd to impart Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; we may aſſure our ſelves it ſhall not be a name or empty notion. But as there ſhall be a Scaene for Juriſdiction to act in; ſo there ſhall be Subjects for it to be exercis'd upon; and Matters alſo to imploy it about.</p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:51858:60"/>
               <p>And ſo here is ſomething <hi>more</hi> ſuggeſted (in way of Reply) as to the Favour which GOD beſtowed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> in relation to the Fiſhes: namely, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to him a <hi>Dominion</hi> over them. And <hi>that</hi> I hope, is quite different from a <hi>Titular Lordſhip.</hi> And ſo Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular was his Lordſhip (according to the Theory) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Fiſh; that tho he held it near a thouſand years, it did not all that time bring one of them to his <hi>Sight.</hi> A man may have a Title to things, and Right to uſe them when he can get them; tho he never had, nor ever ſhall have Dominion over them. I do by no means wiſh the Anſwerer to be unjuſtly barred from his Eſtate. But if he were ſo, he would find that a Title to it, and a Right to uſe it when it ſhould come into his Power; muſt not be compar'd to a real Dominion or Command over it. But now it was an <hi>actual Dominion</hi> which GOD gave <hi>Adam</hi> over the Fiſh. And therefore he did not ſay, <hi>have thou the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Lord</hi> over them, and <hi>uſe</hi> them for thy conveniency, when they come into thy power;</hi> (which yet would have been a plain Jeer (ſuch as Heaven never put upon an Innocent) becauſe into his power they were <hi>not</hi> to come:) but <hi>have DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NION <hi>over the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi> and over the Fowl of the Air, and over every living thing which moveth upon the Earth, Gen.</hi> 1.28. Where, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>and have the Dominion;</hi> does ſignify an <hi>actual</hi> Rule, and the very <hi>exerciſe</hi> of it. And the Word is uſed in this Senſe, in too many Places of the H. Bible to be here recited. So that <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Fiſh, was not (as the Anſwerer would moſt unreaſonably make it) a Titular Lordſhip, or imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Right: which was to hang in the Air, and not be realiz'd even to his Poſterity, till above ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years ſhould be paſt; and till the World in which they lived ſhould be quite deſtroyed, and a new one
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51858:60"/> founded: but it was a <hi>real</hi> Power <hi>actually</hi> conferred <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and exercis'd <hi>in</hi> his own Perſon; and <hi>with</hi> him, by his Children, <hi>jointly;</hi> and <hi>after</hi> him, by <hi>them, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively.</hi> And truly when in the Grant of this power over the Fiſh, the Advantage lay ſo much on <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſide, more than on his Offſpring's; (it being made to him in his Perſon, and alſo in his Innocence:) it may ſeem ſomewhat ſtrange, that he who ſhared moſt in the <hi>conveyance</hi> of the Priviledge; ſhould (in the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a wiſe <hi>Civilian</hi>) have nothing to do with the <hi>Poſſeſion</hi> of it. Eſpecially when this Grant was made by the GOD of faithfulneſs and truth; with Whom, as there is no ſhadow of Change, ſo there can be no ſemblance of Fraud. Yet had the Caſe here been as the Theory makes it; there muſt have been <hi>wrong</hi> on GOD's part, as well as <hi>fallacy;</hi> and his creatures he muſt have injured, by impoſing upon them; which who can think? As if that righteous Being, whoſe Nature is the Rule of eternal Juſtice, could violate that Law which Himſelf had made: And when he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>not to ſteal;</hi> could rob poor men of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right, which his own free Goodneſs, and his own kind Promiſe, ſettled on them.</p>
               <p>Not to be too toedious. Either <hi>Adam</hi> had <hi>actual</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the Fiſh; or he had not. If he had not, why did GOD ſay to him, <hi>Have <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Fiſh of the Sea?</hi> If he had, why does the Anſwerer ſo mince it, as if he intended to make away with it? Again; Either <hi>Adam</hi> had as <hi>much</hi> Power over the Fiſh of the Sea, as he had over the Fowls of the Air, and the Living things upon the Earth; or he had not. If he had as much; we have what we contend for. If he had not; the Anſwerer muſt ſhow, that the Divine <hi>Grant</hi> now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, veſting <hi>Adam</hi> with Dominion over the Creatures; did confer <hi>more Power</hi> in the <hi>latter</hi> part of it, than it did
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:51858:61"/> in the <hi>firſt.</hi> But that he cannot do; and therefore his Cauſe is loſt. For if <hi>Adam</hi> had as much power over the Fiſh, as he had over the Fowls, and over other Animals; there muſt be an <hi>open Sea</hi> at firſt. And if there was an open Sea; there was <hi>Mountains</hi> too. And if there was Mountains; there was <hi>Clouds</hi> alſo. And if there was Clouds; there was <hi>Winds,</hi> and <hi>Rains,</hi> and <hi>Hails,</hi> and <hi>Snows,</hi> and <hi>Thunders,</hi> &amp;c. And then where's the Theoriſts Primitive Earth, and his Paradiſiacal World before the Flood? In the Fourth Chapter of his Anſwer he reflected upon the Excepter for <hi>Dabbling</hi> in Philoſophy. And now I think he has <hi>dabbled</hi> in it fairly himſelf; even till he has drowned his hopeful Hypotheſis, in an inclos'd Abyſs. And as for <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providence,</hi> it affords no help in this Caſe. However it be made too much a Pack-horſe to carry the Theory through ſeveral Difficulties, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt have been impaſſable: yet here it fails, and is able to yield no manner of aſſiſtance. For he who can imagine, that <hi>Adam</hi> upon the Earth, could have Dominion over the Fiſh in this incloſed Sea, by Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Providence; muſt be guilty of moſt ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing and unmerciful Extravagance. Yet by another Expedient he may find relief. When, to leave things out, he prints his Theory next; he may leave this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clos'd Abyſs out of that Edition. And tho he can worſe ſpare it; yet whether he has not as much reaſon to leave it out, as he had to leave <hi>any thing</hi> out, which he <hi>did</hi> leave out;<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>226.</hi>

                  </note>HE begins this Chapter, which is about <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> with a warm Charge upon the Excepter, thus. He <hi>fairly baulks all the the Difficulties in that Doctrine, and contents himſelf with a few generals, which every body knows.</hi> Betwixt the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Difficulties</hi> of an Article, there may be great Difference. And where there is ſo, they muſt be warily noted and diſtinguiſhed. There we muſt duly conſider and examine, whether theſe Difficulties be inherent in the Doctrine, and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from it; or whether they be Appendages or Additionals to it. Whether the Doctrine delivered were interwoven or wrapt up in Difficulties by GOD; or whether thoſe Difficulties were the meer phantſiful inventions of men, annexed to it, or clapt upon it. And in caſe they appear to be extrinſic Acceſſaries, humane Conjectures, or perhaps Extravagancies and Miſtakes: what have we more to do with them, or how can we do better by them, than part the Shadows from the true Subſtance, and ſo throwing off the one, keep cloſe to the other?<note place="margin">Diſc. <hi>p.</hi> 265.</note> And this was what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to our ſelves, when paſſing by the Fictions of Poets, and the Phantſies of Fathers, we betook our ſelves directly to the Oracles of Heaven; reſolving to take up our Reſt there, and to rely upon nothing that Writers ſay concerning Paradiſe (a Scripture Doctrine) but what is conſonant to the Sacred Scriptures; where
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51858:63"/> alone that Doctrine is clearly taught, ſo far as Divine Wiſdom thought fit to reveal it, and acquaint us with it. Tis true, we may go farther if we pleaſe, and ſo ſtretch this Doctrine (as the Theoriſt does) that it ſhall comprehend ſeveral other things. But then if theſe things prove, <hi>Difficulties;</hi> at the ſame time they are but <hi>Superfluities.</hi> Such as GOD never put into the Doctrine of Paradiſe, and men had much better have kept out. And that they are much fitter to be quite cut off, than vigorouſly purſued, and ſeriouſly inſiſted on: may in part be gathered from hence. That they who labour moſt in them, get nothing by them. Their profit will not countervail their trouble: but Study here muſt be, what ſome Philoſophers thought Virtue was; a Reward to it ſelf. The Theoriſt has made himſelf a pregnant Inſtance to prove this. He has taken pains to find out what the Ancients determin'd concerning the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Terreſtial Paradiſe; but to how little purpoſe? For notwithſtanding that its <hi>Place</hi> was a <hi>Real</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (which his <hi>Properties</hi> of it were not;) he had no Requital for his Endeavours to diſcover it.

For <hi>his</hi> inſpired Pen deſcribing that Garden, by the Rivers <hi>Euphrates, Hiddekel, &amp;c.</hi> as principal Marks of its Situation; does place it ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally in our <hi>Northern</hi> World.</p>
               <p>Now had we not better <hi>content our ſelves with a few <hi>Generals</hi> which every body knows,</hi> that are certain; than go thus far, and pay thus dear, for ſingular Notions which are vain and void of truth? But if againſt the Divine Caveat from above, men will <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, be wiſe in their own conceits; and without <hi>Reaſon</hi> to prove them, or <hi>Scripture</hi> to warrant them, will form Opinions to themſelves about ſacred Doctrines; or recommend them to others, even <hi>againſt</hi> Scripture: no wonder that their Studies ſhould tend to Vanity; and that their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions ſhould run out into wild Extravagance; and that having roiled the limpid Streams of Truth, they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51858:65"/> ſhould drink in the muddy waters of Error, to quench their inordinate thirſt of knowledge.</p>
               <p>This is ſpoken in remark of the <hi>Nature</hi> of thoſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which according to the Theory, attend the Doctrine of Paradiſe; and with <hi>Baulking</hi> of which we are charged by the Anſwer. The <hi>place</hi> of Paradiſe our Author makes to be the firſt of them, and he yields it to be in the <hi>South-Eaſt-Land.</hi> But then in yielding it there, by his own Confeſſion, he proceeds without Reaſon, and without Scripture, and we may add <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both;</hi> inaſmuch as it is againſt Reaſon, for a Chriſtian Doctor to go againſt Scripture. Yet if the <hi>place</hi> of Paradiſe is ſuch an hidden, hamper'd, <hi>difficult</hi> Thing (as the Theoriſt makes it) which in it ſelf muſt needs be <hi>real,</hi> becauſe Paradiſe was <hi>Local:</hi> If that, I ſay, in the Circumſtance of its Situation, is ſo <hi>difficult,</hi> latent, and incertain; as to baffle his beſt Attempts of finding it, and render them inſignificant: What ſhall we think of the reſt of thoſe Difficulties, which he calls the <hi>Properties</hi> of Paradiſe? Surely they muſt be ſtrange and unreaſonable Things, to be appropriated to the true Doctrine of Paradiſe; as having nothing of that <hi>certain Reality</hi> in them, which the <hi>place</hi> of Paradiſe had; the meer Site of which prov'd ſo puzzling to him, as to defeat his Labours in ſearching after it, and make them vain and unhappy. And Theſe Difficulties being of this Quality; no <hi>certain, Real</hi> Things; no better than Chimaerical Figments, or Romantick Forgeries; no other than fine and light Ideas, which float only in the Imaginations of the Phantſiful: Such things as GOD never put into the Doctrine of Paradiſe; Such as want Scripture to warrant them, Reaſon to prove them, and even ſo much as clear and ſound Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities to vouch and recommend them; Such as yield no profit, but rather bring Prejudice to Doters upon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51858:66"/> them, and writers about them; as we ſee by a fair Example before us. Theſe Difficulties, I ſay, being of this Strain; if we <hi>had</hi> baulked them, we might well have born the Cenſure of doing it, and as well have juſtifi'd the cenſured Action. But then they were not ſo <hi>Baulked</hi> neither, but that at the ſame time they were <hi>confuted</hi> alſo. For while our ſhort paraphraſe upon the holy Texts, relating to the Place of Paradiſe (and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Divine and only authentic Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) lays down the <hi>Generals</hi> which <hi>Scripture</hi> affirms or teaches concerning it; it ſo far confutes the Theory's <hi>Singularitys,</hi> or Properties of it, as it ſhews, that (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may be <hi>Difficulties</hi> indeed) they are no <hi>real Parts</hi> of the <hi>true</hi> and genuine Doctrine of Paradiſe. If they were, why do not the <hi>ſacred writings</hi> take <hi>ſome</hi> notice of them at leaſt? But they make not the <hi>leaſt</hi> mention of a <hi>Perpetual Aequinox,</hi> of a <hi>perpetual Spring,</hi> or of the Earth's <hi>ſpontaneous Production of Animals;</hi> which the Theory makes to be <hi>Properties</hi> of Paradiſe. Tho from hence we may conclude, that they are falſely ſo counted, they are falſely ſo called, becauſe the Scripture owns them not; nor are they conſentaneous to its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, either in themſelves, or in the train of their Conſequences. It approves of them no more, than it does of Paradiſe's <hi>Prae-exiſtence</hi> to the World; than it does of its Situation under the <hi>Aequinoctial;</hi> than it does of its being <hi>placed</hi> near to the <hi>Moon,</hi> or ſet up ſo <hi>high,</hi> as to be above <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and out of the <hi>reach</hi> of the <hi>Flood.</hi> (Which made the Sons of Infallibility (a ſort of Theological Theoriſts) mount <hi>Enoch</hi> thither before the Deluge; whither after it, they ſent <hi>Elias,</hi> to keep him Company.) Theſe Conceits, in the Judgments of Some (both learned men and ancient Fathers) were <hi>Properties</hi> of Paradiſe. But for all that, they were meer empty Conceits ſtill, nor could they be other.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51858:66"/> Yet let it be noted, they all ſtand in the ſame Rank, and are built on every whit as good Foundations, as the <hi>Theory</hi>'s Properties of Paradiſe are. For tho neither Reaſon nor Scripture do allow or confirm them; yet they are rear'd on expreſs <hi>Authorities</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and ratifi'd by them. But are they of power to authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticate Phantſies, and turn them into Realities?</p>
               <p>But to go on with this Point, upon which I little thought to have ſaid thus much. <hi>Baulking <hi>all</hi> the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the Doctrine of Paradiſe;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Another Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth.</note> is <hi>falſely</hi> charged upon us. And that not only becauſe (as we have ſaid) theſe Difficulties are Shadows, Phantſies, and Falſhoods; And becauſe we have confuted them in a <hi>general</hi> way, by alledging and explaining the true Doctrine of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe delivered from above; which rather contradicts them, than gives countenance to them: But becauſe (as 'tis evident) we did <hi>not <hi>baulk</hi> all <hi>thoſe Difficulties.</hi>
                  </hi> For the <hi>Properties</hi> of Paradiſe, that is to ſay, the <hi>Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Aequinox,</hi> the <hi>Longaevity of the Antediluvians,</hi> and the <hi>Spontaneous or Vital Fertility of the Earth,</hi> were at leaſt <hi>ſome</hi> of the Difficulties meant. Now to the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe we ſpake in the Eighth Chapter of our <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> and ſo had no reaſon to return to it in the Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. And in the Thirteenth Chapter we handled the <hi>other Two;</hi> elſe what means the Anſwer given in to them here?</p>
               <p>But before we conſider the Anſwer he has made, there is one Objection to be removed, which he has thrown in our way. He tells the Animadverter, that <hi>if he would undertake to confute the Theory in this Point,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>55.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>he ſhould have confuted <hi>four</hi> of his <hi>Particulars</hi>
                  </hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Place of Paradiſe; <hi>But he ſlips over theſe.</hi> The Animadverter was to confute <hi>this Aſſertion</hi> of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>The Doctrine of Paradiſe cannot be underſtood, but upon ſuppoſition of the Primitive Earth and its Properties.</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:51858:67"/> Now if he could make it out, that the Doctrine of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe is <hi>intelligible <hi>without</hi>
                  </hi> the Theory; as intelligible <hi>without</hi> it, as it is <hi>with</hi> it; this Aſſertion muſt needs be confuted. This therefore he undertook to do. And it being done, what he intended, and what he was obliged to, was performed. And even theſe <hi>particular Objections</hi> too, tho before not ſo <hi>diſtinctly</hi> made: were <hi>virtually</hi> anſwered, and confuted in the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of them. But however it being expected we ſhould do it, let us ſpeak more expreſsly to theſe <hi>Four Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>55:</hi>
                  </note>The Firſt is this. <hi>The Place of Paradiſe cannot be determin'd by Scripture only.</hi> Firſt, if it cannot be determin'd by Scripture <hi>only,</hi> it muſt be determin'd by Scripture <hi>chiefly.</hi> For that alone gives the beſt grounds whereon, and the beſt light whereby to deſcribe the Place, ſo far as it can be done. And ſecondly, it is not to be doubted, but that at firſt it did <hi>more exactly</hi> define or bound it out: only ſince that time, ſuch changes have happened to the Chanels of Rivers, and the Boundaries of it; as render the Draught or Deſcription of the Country, which was then more exact and clear; dark now and inſufficient. And Scripture having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Paradiſe ſo well at firſt, and contributing ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to the beſt poſſible deſcription of it ſtill; it is that which <hi>did</hi> determine it <hi>only,</hi> in a more ſatisfactory meaſure, once; and that which <hi>does</hi> determine it <hi>only,</hi> in a well qualifi'd ſenſe, to this day; ſo far, that is, as it is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable. And what can be expected from it more?</p>
               <p>The Second is this. <hi>The place of Paradiſe cannot be determin'd by the Theory.</hi> And how ſhould it, when GOD ſignifies it (as we ſhall ſee immediately) to be ſeated in <hi>one</hi> Hemiſphere, and <hi>that</hi> fixes it in the <hi>other?</hi> But is it not pretty then, that the Animadverter, if he would confute the Theory, ſhould be put to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute this Particular? That is, he muſt prove the Theory
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51858:67"/> 
                  <hi>can</hi> do, what it <hi>cannot</hi> do. A notable way of ſecuring an Hypotheſis; to tie him who attaques it, to do a thing that is impoſſible, whereby to overthrow it.</p>
               <p>The Third is this. <hi>If we appeal to Antiquity in this caſe, we ſhall find that it</hi> (Paradiſe) <hi>was not in</hi> Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia. But according to his own Rule, <hi>Antiquity</hi> without <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> to back it, is not to be <hi>depended</hi> on. And for the ſame reaſon, his <hi>Fourth Particular</hi> falls of it ſelf; which is this, <hi>According to the plurality of Votes, both amongſt the Heathen and Chriſtian Authors, it was plac'd in the other Hemiſphere.</hi> But theſe Heathen and Chriſtian Authors, having neither Reaſon nor Scripture to ſecond what they ſay; (again we repeat it) they are not to be <hi>depended</hi> on: nor can the Anſwerer, if he ſtands to his word, aſſert Paradiſe to have been where they place it, upon their <hi>credit</hi> or <hi>authority.</hi> But we have ſomething elſe to offer, which will reach <hi>both</hi> the Particulars at once. The Beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity in the whole World, is <hi>Scripture.</hi> And if we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to that, we ſhall find it moſt probable, that the ſeat of Paradiſe was <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> or ſome Region there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts; by the ſeveral broad Signs which it gives us thereof, in the Second Chapter of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> For</p>
               <p>Firſt, That is <hi>Eaſtward</hi> of the place where <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote. And it is ſaid, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8. that <hi>the LORD GOD planted a Garden <hi>Eaſtward.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>251.</hi>
                  </note> And whereas our Author would have <hi>Mikkedhem</hi> there, to ſignify, <hi>in the beginning; Moſes</hi> teaches us plainly that it ſignifies, <hi>in the Eaſt,</hi> by uſing the word in that ſenſe himſelf, in the very next Chapter. For in the laſt Verſe of it, he ſays, that GOD <hi>placed Cherubim and a flaming Sword,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> of the Garden of</hi> Eden. But to have rendred it thus, <hi>he placed <hi>in the Beginning</hi> of the Garden of</hi> Eden, <hi>Cherubim and a flaming Sword;</hi> would have been a very improper and ill Reddition. And as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51858:68"/> often as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> do occur in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which I think, is at leaſt thirty times, beſides <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8. I do not find that they can, in any <hi>one</hi> place, be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred otherwiſe than, <hi>Eaſt, Eaſtward, of the Eaſt,</hi> or <hi>in the Eaſt.</hi> Which if they cannot, it is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that <hi>Mikkedhem, Gen.</hi> 2.8. muſt be rendred, <hi>in the Eaſt;</hi> not, <hi>in the Beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Eden</hi> is there; the Country wherein Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe was planted. So we read again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.8 that <hi>the LORD GOD planted a Garden Eaſtward in EDEN.</hi> And tho <hi>He</hi> would have <hi>Eden</hi> ſignify,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and ſo read the Text thus; <hi>the LORD GOD planted a Garden <hi>in pleaſure:</hi>
                  </hi> that cannot be the true meaning. For the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; and ſo it muſt be read, <hi>the LORD GOD planted a Garden <hi>in pleaſure;</hi>
                  </hi> which would ſound but harſhly. And in the next Verie but one, it is ſaid, that <hi>a River went out of</hi> Eden <hi>to water the Garden.</hi> But to ſay a River went out of <hi>pleaſure</hi> to water the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; would be no good ſenſe. And in the fourth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> we meet with a Paſſage, which ſhows that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> by <hi>Mikkedhem, <hi>muſt</hi>
                  </hi> mean <hi>the Eaſt,</hi> and not <hi>the Beginning;</hi> and by <hi>Eden,</hi> a <hi>Country,</hi> and not <hi>pleaſure.</hi> For telling us there at the 16th. Verſe, which way the Land of <hi>Nod</hi> lay, where <hi>Cain</hi> dwelt; he ſays, it was <hi>on the Eaſt of Eden.</hi> But for him to have ſaid, it was <hi>in the beginning of Pleaſure;</hi> would have been an odd account of its Situation. After all which (if it will not ſeem ſuperfluous) may be added the words ſpoken by <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> in the perſon of his Maſter, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 37.12. <hi>Have the GODS of the Nations delivered them which my Fathers have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as</hi> Gozan, <hi>and</hi> Haran, <hi>and</hi> Rezeph, <hi>and the Children of</hi> Eden <hi>which were in</hi> Talaſſar?<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ezekiel</hi> alſo puts <hi>Haran,</hi> and <hi>Canneh,</hi> and <hi>Eden</hi> together. Whence it plainly appears, that <hi>Eden</hi> was as much the proper
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:51858:68"/> name of a place, as <hi>Rezeph,</hi> or <hi>Canneh,</hi> or any of thoſe mention'd. And alſo that that place was in the Eaſtern part of our Continent; becauſe the other places or Regions here joined with it, lay about it, or bordered upon it. And ſo it might be in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> too; tho it could not be in the Southern Hemiſphere. And it is obſervable that when <hi>Jacob</hi> journied to <hi>Haran</hi> in <hi>Meſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potamia;</hi> he is ſaid to come <hi>into the land of the Children of <hi>the Eaſt,</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, the Land of <hi>Havilah</hi> is there; about which the River <hi>Piſon</hi> is ſaid to fetch a compaſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.11. Not the <hi>Indian Havilah</hi> (as ſome have greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: and by that miſtake have been led into another, that <hi>Piſon</hi> was <hi>Ganges:</hi>) but that <hi>Havilah</hi> which was ſo called from the Son of <hi>Cuſh.</hi> Whereas the other <hi>Havi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> took its denomination from the Son of <hi>Joctan. Strabo</hi> alſo placeth the <hi>Havilah</hi> that relates to Paradiſe, in the Confines of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Meſopotamia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Land of <hi>Cuſh</hi> is there; ſo denominated from <hi>Cuſh</hi> the Son of <hi>Ham,</hi> who ſettled himſelf and his Family in it. It is ſaid to be compaſſed with the River <hi>Gihon, Gen.</hi> 2.13. and it is the <hi>Aſiatic Aethiopia.</hi> Tho ſome preſuming that the <hi>African Aethiopia</hi> was there meant, concluded that <hi>Gihon</hi> muſt be the <hi>Nile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Hiddekel</hi> or <hi>Tigris</hi> is there; which is ſaid to run towards the Eaſt of <hi>Aſſyria, Gen.</hi> 2.14. Upon whoſe Stream riſing from the <hi>Gordian</hi> Mountains in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Armenia,</hi> and flowing Southwards to the dividing of <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> from <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> ſtands the Principal City of that Country, the famous <hi>Ninive,</hi> built by <hi>Aſſur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that Celebrated River of <hi>Aſia,</hi> is there alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.14. I mean in that Eaſtern part of our Continent.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:51858:69"/>
               <p>Now are not all theſe Regions and Rivers, in, or about <hi>Eden,</hi> or <hi>Meſopotamia?</hi> And are they not Marks of the Earthly Paradiſe? And were they not made ſo by <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf? And was not he directed by the H. GHOST? And might it not be in <hi>Meſopotamia</hi> then, or muſt it not be near it? For had it been out of it, and remote from it; what wiſe man inſpired by GOD, would have deſcribed it by ſuch Rivers, and deſcrib'd it by ſuch Regions as lay about <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> and were contermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous with it, or bordering upon it? and if ſome of theſe Rivers, and ſome of theſe Regions, be very much chang'd in their Names and Poſtures, ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote; that's no marvel.

               <p>So that upon the whole Matter, let Rabbies, and Fathers, and Poets, and Theoriſts ſay what they pleaſe; yet ſo long as <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the ſecond Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> and his hand was guided by the moſt HOLY and unerring SPIRIT; we cannot but think, that men in reaſon ought to conclude, and that in duty they ought to believe, that Paradiſe was ſeated in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> or thereabouts.

               <p>Tho we muſt obſerve withal, that the Fathers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeated Paradiſe in <hi>the other Hemiſphere</hi> neither. They only <hi>ſeem</hi> to <hi>incline</hi> to that, by the Theoriſts <hi>due interpretation</hi> of them, as was noted above. And as to the Seat of Paradiſe (as he ſays) they <hi>expreſſed themſelves</hi> in <hi>various ways.</hi> That is, their Notions of it were incertain; and in plain terms, they knew not where to fix it. But ſo far were they from believing it
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:51858:70"/> to be in the Southern Hemiſphere, that they did not believe <hi>that</hi> Hemiſphere was ever <hi>inhabited;</hi> for they did not believe that there were <hi>Antipodes.</hi> And when ſome of them would have Paradiſe to be <hi>Myſtical</hi> only; and others would have it to be the <hi>whole Earth;</hi> and others place it under the <hi>Aequinoctial;</hi> and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Globe</hi> or <hi>Circle of the Moon;</hi> and others in the <hi>exterior part</hi> of a <hi>flat</hi> or plain Earth, round the inward part of which, they ſuppoſed the Ocean to ſtand like a Ring: Which of them ſet it in the <hi>Southern Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere?</hi> Tho if they had, we need not have been much ſurpriz'd at it neither. For being but men, they might have done as men; have erred, that is, in their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. And truly ever ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> through deſire of Knowledge, firſt planted error in Paradiſe; that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Weed has been apt to Spring up and ſpread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily in other places, and the beſt Gardens of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity have been ſtained with it. Witneſs the <hi>Millenium;</hi> the <hi>Rebaptizing of Haeretics;</hi> the <hi>Limbus Patrum;</hi> the <hi>Communicating of Infants;</hi> and the like. And if we'll take in Errors of a lower Strain, we ſhall find the falſe Notions entertained by the Ancients, of the <hi>Form of the Earth,</hi> of the <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Situation of the Sea,</hi> of the <hi>non-exiſtence of Antipodes,</hi> &amp;c. ready to confirm and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the Teſtimony.

                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> believed the <hi>Milky Way</hi> to be a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teor.</hi> He alſo allowed but <hi>Eight</hi> Heavenly Sphaeres; which <hi>Timocaris,</hi> above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the Incarnation, improved to <hi>Nine;</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> (in the thirteeneth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury after it) into <hi>Ten;</hi> and afterward they were commonly reckoned <hi>Eleven.</hi> And not only <hi>Egyptians, Graecians,</hi> and <hi>Arabians,</hi> but even <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctors, took the Stars to be <hi>living Bodies</hi> actuated with <hi>Souls;</hi> as <hi>Eſpencaeus</hi> informs us in his Treatiſe <hi>de Cal. animat.</hi>
                  </note> but a Maſs of Errors? Where ſuch a Syſteme was contrived for the Heavens, and ſuch a ſituation aſſigned to the Earth; as neither Reaſon can approve, nor Nature allow. Yet ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous and prevailing was this Hypotheſis, that it was generally received and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:51858:70"/> propagated for many Ages. And when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were ſo miſconceived, and the Earth ſo miſplaced; and the Errors touching both, were ſpread ſo far, and continued ſo long: why might not the ſame happen as to Paradiſe? Why might not the <hi>Ancients,</hi> and the choiceſt of the Ancients miſtake concerning it, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concerning the <hi>place</hi> of it?</p>
               <p>Were an Account to be given of the Original or Occaſion of this their Miſtake; it might ſeem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks to have riſen thus, or proceeded from hence. They thought and ſpake <hi>too Great things</hi> of Paradiſe, and ſuppoſed ſuch Properties and Excellencies in it, as it never had, nor was capable of. And having rais'd their Phantſies to ſo high a Pitch, they could not tell how to let them fall again, and ſtoop ſo low as <hi>Meſopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia.</hi> And ſo they conceited that Paradiſe was in ſome remote, unknown, inacceſſible Region, or as it were in another World, becauſe they could find out no place in this, which anſwered the gay Notions that they had, and their fine but falſe Idea's of it. Juſt as the <hi>Jews</hi> overlookt the Perſon of the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it came not up to that vain and extravagant Character of Him, unhappily imprinted on their Minds: So theſe pious, learned, and incomparable men, took no notice of the real Place of Paradiſe, as being prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt with miſapprehenſions of it. The lofty Opinions which they had concerning it, lifted up their Thoughts far above it, and carry'd them away quite beyond it. They imagin'd that it was they knew not well what, and ſo they placed it they knew not well where; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they ſhould wrong it, if they fixt it any where in this ordinary World.</p>
               <p>The Excepter having done with the <hi>Place</hi> of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; he objected next againſt the <hi>Longaevity</hi> of men before the flood, as a <hi>Property</hi> of it. <hi>But this,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">p. 55.</note> ſays
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:51858:71"/> the Anſwerer, <hi>he handles ſo looſely, that in the concluſion of his Diſcourſe, one cannot tell whether he affirms it or denies it.</hi> The Excepter begins his diſcourſe of this matter,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>273.</hi>
                  </note> with theſe very words. <hi>As for the Longaevity of the Antediluvians, that could be <hi>no</hi> Property or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct of Paradiſe.</hi> And did he not <hi>deny</hi> then, and <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> deny the Longaevity of the Antediluvians, <hi>as a Property of Paradiſe,</hi> which is his notion of it? And becauſe the Anſwerer does affirm the thing, by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>local</hi> Paradiſe into <hi>two parts,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſwer. p. 55.</note> the <hi>Place,</hi> and the <hi>Properties</hi> of it, and making this Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian Longevity <hi>one</hi> of thoſe Properties: the Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant continues the poſitive Negation, and ſays expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as before, that the Longaevity of the Antediluvians could be <hi>no Property</hi> of Paradiſe. He makes it good thus. If it had been ſo, it would have ceaſed, or have been extinguiſht in Mankind, by their loſs of that Place. For where-ever Priviledges are the Properties of a Place, he that enjoys them, can hold them no longer than he continues in that place. If once he forfeits the Place, and be diſpoſſeſs'd of that; together with it, he muſt actually loſe all thoſe Priviledges which are Properties of it, and be deprived of them. And this Longaevity being (according to our Author) a Property of the <hi>Place</hi> of Paradiſe; <hi>Adam</hi> and his Children could not be priviledg'd with it as ſuch, when he himſelf was ſoon turn'd out of it, and none of <hi>them</hi> were ever in it. Beſides, how could this Longaevity be a <hi>Property</hi> of the Particular <hi>Topical</hi> Paradiſe; when he makes it to be <hi>one</hi> of his three <hi>general</hi> Characters,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. l. <hi>2.</hi> c. <hi>2, 3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> Primitive Earth? Yet a Property of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Paradiſe it muſt needs be, becauſe it is <hi>one</hi> of the Properties meant, where he divides the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of that Paradiſe, into the <hi>Place,</hi> and the <hi>Properties</hi> of, that Place. But then is not here ſomething like <hi>Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:51858:71"/> again, where a Property of <hi>one particular Place</hi> of the Earth, is made <hi>common</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> habitable Earth?</p>
               <p>Indeed the Excepter did not <hi>poſitively</hi> deny the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaevity of the <hi>Antediluvians</hi> to be <hi>General.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Anſwerer taxes him with <hi>Sceptical humour.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>55.</hi>
                  </note> But if the contrary humour will pleaſe him better, the Replicant will ſo far put it on, as <hi>poſitively</hi> to affirm that the Praediluvian Longaevity cannot be founded upon the Hypotheſis of the Theory. For in caſe it ſtands upon that foundation, it muſt be ſupported by a conſtant Aequinox and an Oval Earth. And that Earth muſt be without Metals and without a Sea. And then as <hi>Adam</hi> could have no Dominion over the Fiſh; ſo neither could <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> trade in Braſs or Iron. And if theſe things were thus, plain Scripture muſt be falſe, and <hi>Moſes</hi> muſt be out in the hiſtory of the Creation. <hi>He</hi> was deceiv'd, that is, that <hi>we</hi> might be ſo; and the SPIRIT of Truth which actuated <hi>him,</hi> is become the Author of Lies to <hi>us;</hi> which GOD forbid any one ſhould think.</p>
               <p>After this he obſerves,<note place="margin">ib. p. <hi>56.</hi>
                  </note> that the Excepter did not <hi>take notice of the two laſt Reoſons</hi> he gave, in confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Antediluvian Longaevity.

                  <hi>There were Giants on the Earth in thoſe days.</hi> Now as his telling the World, there were ſome Giants then, does not imply that the whole Race of Mankind were ſuch; but does rather import that the reſt were otherwiſe: ſo his mentioning ſome ſo very Long-livers; may inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate that the reſt were not ſo. To this it is anſwered;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:51858:72"/> 
                  <hi>there had been ſome pretence for this,</hi>

                  <hi>if</hi> Moſes <hi>had made a diſtinction of two races of men in the firſt World: Long-livers and Short-livers; as he hath diſtinguiſht the Giants from the Common race of Mankind.</hi> And is not his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction <hi>equally</hi> plain in <hi>both</hi> caſes? Or if there be any difference, does he not diſtinguiſh <hi>better</hi> betwixt long-livers and ſhort-livers; than he does betwixt men of Gigantic, and of uſual Proportions? For whereas to diſtinguiſh Giants from ordinary men, he only ſaid, <hi>there were Giants on the Earth in thoſe days;</hi> he did <hi>more</hi> than ſay there were Long-livers on the Earth in thoſe days: for he ſpecifi'd their <hi>Names,</hi> and he ſet down their <hi>Ages,</hi> ſignifying clearly both <hi>who</hi> they were, and to <hi>what years</hi> they reached. But on the other ſide, he neither expreſſed who the Giants were, nor what their Stature and Dimenſions. So that of the two, he diſtinguiſhes more plainly betwixt long-livers and ſhort-livers; than betwixt the Giants and men of common ſize. For thus indeed he fairly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that the <hi>Generality</hi> of the praediluvians were <hi>ſhort livers,</hi> by his care to <hi>particularize</hi> thoſe that liv'd <hi>long;</hi> and both by their <hi>names,</hi> and by the <hi>length</hi> of their days, to <hi>diſcriminate</hi> them from the reſt. And tho the Anſwerer ſays, in the cloſe of his Paragraph, that <hi>not to ſuppoſe</hi> long life <hi>general to Mankind at that time, is a groundleſs reſtriction, which is neither founded upon Scripture nor reaſon:</hi> We reply, that it may be <hi>founded upon <hi>both.</hi>
                  </hi> For <hi>Scripture</hi> ſays, <hi>in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely dye, Gen.</hi> 2.17. And tho this Sentence was denounc'd againſt man condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at firſt, in caſe he ſinned; yet upon his actual diſobedience, it became poſitive as it were, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute. And when Scripture makes this the Sentence of GOD; (Who had ſufficient power to execute it, as well as juſt and mighty provocation to do it:) after
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:51858:73"/> once it took place, it muſt be conſonant to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that ſhort life rather than long life, ſhould be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lot of men. And ſo both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> plainly ſuggeſt, that they who lived eight or nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, under this Sentence, muſt in all likelihood ow their Longaevity to the favour of Heaven, and a ſpecial Benediction; rather than to the ſtrength of their own nature within, or any Courſe or Order of Nature without.

                  </hi> But as the Sea takes away from <hi>this</hi> Earth, ſo the Torrid Zone and Rainy Regions took away from <hi>that. That</hi> Earth alſo had no Mountains, which in this are great as well as nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous; and do very much inlarge its Capacity or room for Inhabitants. And whereas he ſuggeſts, that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are <hi>leſs habitable</hi> than Plains,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>by reaſon of their barrenneſs:</hi> It muſt be conſidered firſt, that a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous Earth muſt have Valleys in it. And as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are more barren than Plains, ſo Valleys are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more fruitful than they; and alſo receptive of more Dwellers. That is, by reaſon of their hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and declivities, they are more capacious than Plains, whoſe ſuperficial extent is equal to the tops of theſe Valleys, if meaſured by lines drawn from ſide to ſide. Secondly, tho ſome Mountains be barren, others are as fruitful. <hi>Taurus,</hi> for inſtance, which takes its Denomination, as ſome think, from its Magnitude; and is the Greateſt Mountain in all <hi>Aſia</hi> (being as we are told, fifty Miles broad in ſome places on the Top of it, and fifteen hundred long, reaching from the Ocean of <hi>Chinah,</hi> to the Sea of <hi>Pamphylia;</hi>) on the ſides of it is prodigious fruitful, tho its higheſt parts are covered with Snow. For it affords Honey, Wheat, Gums, Wines, and Fruits in vaſt Quantities. What he intimates touching <hi>Holland,</hi> that there are more peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

                  <hi>becauſe this</hi> (decuple proportion) <hi>would riſe far beyond the capacities of this Earth.</hi> That is, it would not be <hi>uneaſy</hi> in the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>reality</hi> of the thing; but uneaſy in regard of the Theory's <hi>Hypotheſis.</hi> It would not be uneaſy for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to <hi>multiply</hi> in a <hi>decuple</hi> proportion; but it would be uneaſy for the Theory to <hi>allow</hi> they did ſo; becauſe then, as the Excepter urges, the Earth would have been <hi>overcharg'd</hi> with their numerous increaſe. And when the Excepter cited ſo much of the Theory, as carried the whole Truth of the Matter in it; he had no reaſon to go farther in citing more of it, which was added but to ſerve the Theory <hi>againſt</hi> the Truth: nor is there reaſon why he ſhould be counted or called <hi>partial,</hi> becauſe he did not do it. That every Pair of breeders ſhould at the end of every Century leave ten pair more; is eaſy and allowable, becauſe, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, true in it ſelf: and was the Excepter to take in a lower proportion, becauſe this higher one was not for the Theoriſt's purpoſe? The firſt Suppoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaſy, and in all probability true; why ſhould a ſecond be admitted, to render that uneaſy and falſe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:51858:75"/> meerly becauſe it favours not him who made it? But let him ſhow why <hi>Seth</hi> and his Wife, and <hi>Enos</hi> and his Wife, and other pairs downward, may not be allowed to multiply in the ſame decuple proportion that the firſt pair are allowed to do; and then the Excepter will own himſelf faulty for not enlarging the Citation, and taking in the Quadruple proportion mentioned. But becauſe in all probability, they multipli'd in equal meaſures; he had no reaſon to be blam'd as partial, for leaving it out. Tho the truth is, if but the <hi>Quadruple</hi> proportion be admitted, it will ſet the Number of the Praediluvians very much too high, if compar'd with the Number of the preſent Earth's Inhabitants; as the Theoriſt computes them both. For whereas he thinks that <hi>the preſent number of men upon the face of the Earth, is commonly eſtimated to be betwixt three and four hundred Millions:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>23.</hi>
                  </note> the Quadruple proportion, in ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years (which paſſed before the Flood came in) would raiſe it to 21474836480.

Or if we quite lay aſide this <hi>Quadruple</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and go but according to that <hi>other Citation</hi> out of the Theory before this; the Earth would <hi>ſtill</hi> be overlaid with the multitude of its Inhabitants.<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 279.</note> The Citation runs thus. <hi>'Tis likely they were more fruitful in the firſt Ages of the World, than after the Flood; and they lived ſix, ſeven, eight, nine hundred years apiece, getting Sons and Daughters.</hi> And when men lived ſo many hundreds of years before the Flood, and lived getting of Sons and Daughters, and were <hi>more</hi> fruitful, <hi>then,</hi> than ſince; how is it poſſible but that the firſt Earth in ſixteen hundred years, muſt be mightily over-peopled; eſpecially when <hi>Digamy,</hi> and (as the H.

If the firſt, he reflects upon the honour of</hi> Moſes, <hi>or confutes himſelf. Moſes</hi>'s To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography of Paradiſe, as it was done by proper Rules, ſo it was ſufficient and effectual enough for marking it out, as it <hi>once</hi> ſtood. And that it is not ſo <hi>now,</hi> is becauſe (as the ſecond Anſwer intimates) there has been a <hi>great change</hi> in the Earth, in that part of the Earth where the Paradiſiacal Region was. And ſuch a change may be allowed without <hi>joining</hi> with the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:51858:77"/> as he Himſelf aſſures us. For he tells us in the ſame page, that good interpreters ſuppoſe, that the Chanels of Rivers were <hi>very much changed</hi> by the Flood. And a great change in the Chanels of Rivers, muſt make a great change in a Country: Eſpecially where that Country is deſcrib'd by thoſe Rivers; which is the caſe of Paradiſe. And this change is the very thing which makes the place of Paradiſe ſo hard to be found. Yet this, I ſay, is very far from <hi>joining</hi> with the Theoriſt. For according to him, the Chanels of Rivers were not only <hi>changed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>252.</hi>
                  </note> but <hi>all broke up,</hi> and ſo quite put by, by that Fraction of the Earth which made the Flood. And not only the <hi>Chanels</hi> of Rivers were deſtroyed, but even the <hi>Sources</hi> of them too, by his Hypotheſis. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the general Sources of all Rivers in the primitive World, were the Rainy Regions about the Poles; Thoſe Polar Regions fell in together with the reſt, and ſo Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which were before, could not afterward continue. Let him pleaſe to ſay therefore whether <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> were before the Flood or not. If they were not, how could <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribe Paradiſe by them? If they were, had the Flood come in by the Earth's Diſſolution, they muſt inevitably have been deſtroyed. But inſtead of that, they are ſtill in being; and this is an evidence that the Earth was not delug'd, by being diſſolv'd. Nor is this the only difficulty upon the Theoriſt here. For as to the place of Paradiſe, he refers himſelf wholly (as we have heard) to the Ancients; and they incline to ſeat it in the South, or South-Eaſt Land, in the other World. And can it enter into the mind of man to think, that <hi>Havilah,</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> and <hi>Hidde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> takes into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Paradiſe; could ever be ſituate in the <hi>other</hi> Hemiſphere, when they are now found in <hi>this?</hi> If the Earth fell in, without queſtion it gave a deadly jounce.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:51858:77"/> But could it make theſe Countries and Rivers rebound with ſuch force, as to leap quite beyond the torrid Zone, and ſettle ſome degrees on this ſide of our Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic?

I confeſs we are taught ſtrange things of Paradiſe; but this its tranſlation would ſurpaſs all. And how good ſoever its Soil was at firſt, certainly it grew very light at laſt, to hop thus far. Were this an effect of the Earth's fall, believe it, here is either a very fair tumbling Caſt; or elſe our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is in a foul miſtake.

               <p>But out of this fear, he quickly riſes into another Paſſion, if we may gueſs by his expreſſions in the next Paragraph. Tho I cannot but ſay, his Paſſion is as cauſeleſs, as his fear was groundleſs. For, ſpeaking truth in a controverſy, ſhould never move choler. And did the Excepter do more than ſo, when he ſaid, that to <hi>affirm Moſes</hi>'s <hi>Deſcription of Paradiſe to be falſe,</hi>

                  <hi>muſt be horrid Blaſphemy, it being Dictated by the H. GHOST?</hi> Yet this is the word which he takes ſo ill. And truly ſo far as he has ſaid any thing, that implies <hi>Moſe</hi>'s To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pography of Paradiſe to be falſe; So far he ought to reſent what was ſpoken; tho not with anger. And, pray, how can he (allowing own Hypotheſis to be
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:51858:78"/> true) defend <hi>Moſes</hi>'s deſcription of Paradiſe from being falſe; ſeeing he deſcribes it by Rivers, and thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, according to the Theory, could not be before the Flood?

                  <hi>'Tis true, if you admit our</hi> Hypotheſis, <hi>concerning the fraction and diſruption of the Earth at the Deluge, then we cannot expect to find rivers, <hi>as they were before,</hi> their general ſource is changed, and their Chanels are all broke up.</hi> And if Rivers after the Flood, are not <hi>as they were before</hi> it; how can they be <hi>alike?</hi> And when their ſource was changed at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and their Chanels all broke up; how is it poſſible but that they muſt differ <hi>greatly</hi> from what they were, in their ſituations, Courſes, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Which muſt utterly ſpoil them for being topographical marks; I mean the ſame true topographical marks to any Country, to which they formerly were ſo: And can they then be alike?

               <p>And then laſtly, the Theoriſt yields Paradiſe was in the <hi>Southern</hi> Hemiſphere, and ſo the Rivers of it before the Flood muſt be there too, and ſo they muſt riſe from the rainy Region at the <hi>Antarctic</hi> Pole, and ſo they muſt be very remote from the Land of <hi>Havilah</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Whereas ſince the Flood, <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe by <hi>Tygris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and theſe are Rivers in this <hi>Northern</hi> Hemiſphere, and they ſpring up from the Mountains of <hi>Armenia,</hi> and they run by or through the aforeſaid Countries.

The <hi>Anſwerer,</hi> that there was no neceſſity that the Ark ſhould be afloat before the Earth broke, becauſe the Angels could hold it in the Air; and they having charge over it, <hi>did</hi> bear it up in their hands. The Queſtion therefore might be put, which of the two ſpeaks trueſt.

And ſo what was premiſed in the Theory, of this <hi>ſoftning</hi> Nature; and what the Excepter is blamed for <hi>not noting,</hi> was of as little uſe, as it is of truth. And to ſhut up this particular; by calling in this extraordinary help of the Angels, he renders the Rains at the Deluge (the principal Cauſe of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.4.) wholly <hi>unneceſſary.</hi> For tho at <hi>first</hi> he would have them to ſave the Ark by ſetting it afloat; yet <hi>now</hi> we ſee there was <hi>no neceſſity</hi> of that. And then if the Earth fell into the Abyſs, and by its fall made the waters of it ſo <hi>raging</hi> and <hi>deſtructive</hi> to all things, as he repreſents them; there could be no more need of forty days rain in order to the Flood; than of forty Candles to give light to the Sun.

Tho it is well known, that an ingenious <hi>French</hi> Writer, I mean <hi>Duval</hi> (in his <hi>Geogr. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſ.</hi>) aſcribes both the <hi>Muddineſs, Fruitfulneſs,</hi> and <hi>Overflow</hi> of it; to its <hi>Nitrous</hi> Quality. His words are to this purpoſe. <hi>It has lately been found out, that the</hi> Nitre <hi>wherewith the</hi> Nile <hi>abounds ſo much, is the cauſe of all thoſe wonderful Effects; and that being heated by the ſun, it mingles it ſelf with the water, renders it troubled, ſwells it, and makes it paſs over its Banks.</hi> But yet concerning this noble River it is as well known; that as ſometimes it has not increaſed at all, (as in the tenth and eleventh year of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> againſt the downfal and the death of that Princeſs, and her admired <hi>Anthony:</hi>) and as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is defective in its increaſe, to lamentable failures in the uſual Products of that plentiful Country: So if at any time it happens to exceed in its increment, but two or three Cubits; that exceſs is at once both a clear Prognoſtic, and a certain Cauſe, of a dearth or ſcarcity in the enſuing year. But then that ſuch a Deluge as the Theory ſuppoſes, (it being Univerſal, and of long continuance, and made of lean ſubterraneous water, and full of dead, and harſh, and heavy ſoil, fetcht off from numberleſs pieces of the broken Earth) ſhould occaſion barrenneſs, for a conſiderable time, in the poſt-diluvian World; is but reaſonable to conclude. Nor laſtly does this part of the Objection lie againſt the common Explication of the Deluge, with ſuch force as it does againſt the Theory's Explication of it. For
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:51858:83"/> tho a General Flood overtopping the Mountains, muſt have left mud, and ſlime, and filth behind it; yet where the water riſe upon an Earth that remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken, they could be nothing in <hi>quantity,</hi> to what they muſt have been where the Earth was diſſolv'd and fell all to pieces; and where the water boiling up from under theſe Fragments, and then falling down again violently upon them, raged amongſt them with laſting, inceſſant, and unimaginable turbulence.</p>

Which in caſe it had been but yielded at firſt, it might have ſav'd the pains, of ſetting up this Hypotheſis. And not only ſo, but likewiſe have ſuperſeded the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral trouble, of too weak and ineffectual endeavours to ſupport it. And when all is ſaid, the <hi>ſole</hi> reaſon why ſuch another flood as <hi>Noah</hi>'s was, ſhall never come in again; is not any change in Nature, rendring the thing difficult or impoſſible; but the unchangeable <hi>covenant</hi> of GOD, as appears, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 54.9. Where GOD, to illuſtrate the ſtability of his kindneſs to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, and to ſhow that its calamity ſhall never be reiterated; compares it to the ſure and perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the waters of <hi>Noah,</hi> to the return of which, his immutable <hi>Oath</hi> is the eternal bar. <hi>For this is as the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>unto me: for as I have <hi>ſworn</hi> that the waters of</hi> Noah <hi>ſhould <hi>no more</hi> go over the Earth; ſo have I ſworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</hi>

               <p>HEre the Scaene changes; and our Anſwerer now becomes an Objector; and manages this part, as he did the other. And as an inſtance of as much, he trips in the firſt ſtep that he makes, and ſtumbles into a Miſtake. For he affirms,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>66.</hi>

                  </hi> Under what notion muſt this Propoſition be receiv'd? As a <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> or as a <hi>Concluſion?</hi> If it be a <hi>Poſtulatum,</hi> it muſt be clear from its own light, or acknowledg'd by general conſent. It cannot pretend to be clear from its own light, becauſe it is matter of fact, which is not known but by teſtimony. Neither is it generally acknowledg'd; For the general opinion is, that the Firſt Earth had an Open Sea. Wherefore we may well goon (with a little variation) againſt the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, as he does againſt the Excepter. <hi>It muſt not therefore be made a</hi> Poſtulatum, <hi>that ſuch an Aſſertion is true, but the truth of it muſt be demonſtrated by good proofs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>67.</hi>
                  </note> But the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>demonſtrating</hi> proofs of this, are ſtill wanting. And ſo that blame which he would fling upon the Excepter, falls upon himſelf; recoiling back by juſt recrimination.</p>
               <p>Next he is for noting <hi>one or two things, wherein</hi> the Excepter <hi>ſeems to be inconſiſtent with himſelf, or with good ſenſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib.</note> An high Charge, and ſuch as inevitably draws ſhame after it, either upon him againſt whom it is made, or elſe upon the Maker of it.

Yet as if he would make good his charge out of theſe very words; he Querys immediately, <hi>But why does he then trouble himſelf, or the World, with an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, which he does not believe to be true and real?</hi> Many have written ingenious and uſeful things, which they never believed to be <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real:</hi> but were they for this <hi>troublers</hi> of the World, and <hi>inconſiſtent with themſelves,</hi> or <hi>with good ſenſe?</hi> And why then ſhould the Excepter's Hypotheſis be ſo, for his not believing it to be true and real?

                  <hi>Our Suppoſition ſtands ſupported by Divine authority: as being founded upon Scripture.

For to be ſupported by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and plain Scripture, is as much as we can alledge for the Articles of our faith; which every one ſurely is bound to defend.</hi> In our entrance on this new Hypotheſis, we deſired allowance to <hi>make bold with Scripture a <hi>little,</hi> as the Theory had done <hi>a great deal.</hi>

                  </note> And afterward we declared, that we had no reaſon to take our ſingularity in expounding <hi>a Text or two of Scripture,</hi>

                  </note> as an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt us; if brought by the <hi>Theoriſt,</hi> or <hi>them</hi> that hold with him. For <hi>that</hi> indeed is but an imperfect Tranſcript of his own Copy, and a faint imitation of his extravagant Pattern; ſhowing him, as in a dark and ſhort reſemblance, a ſhadow of that large unuſual Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which he aſſum'd to himſelf, not eaſy to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell'd. And therefore for him to lay hold of our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting our Hypotheſis by plain Scripture (as if we forc'd or wreſted, miſinterpreted or miſapply'd it in ſo doing, when at the ſame time we openly profeſs, that we make <hi>bold</hi> with it;) is no better than a foreſtalled Argument; otherwiſe a Cavil. And farther, (as the Anſwerer himſelf noted juſt now) we would not be <hi>bound to defend what we ſay,</hi> of the new Hypotheſis, <hi>as true and real.</hi> And therefore the founding it upon Scripture, and making that to ſupport it plainly; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be underſtood, by men of ſenſe, to be done otherwiſe than in an <hi>hypothetic</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſitious</hi> way. And thus the Excepter is ſo far from proving <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with himſelf or good ſenſe; that how could he be more <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with both, than in refuſing to defend, as true and real, what he only <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to be thus <hi>founded</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Scripture and <hi>ſupported</hi> by it. And whatever he ſaid of that nature, was ſpoken only in way of ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition conjectural. Yea, tho it was ſpoken never ſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:51858:86"/> 
                  <hi>poſitively,</hi> it was but to ſet forth, <hi>rei perſonam;</hi> to make the more full and lively repreſentation of the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thing. And therefore before he began his new Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Flood, he premiſed this caution (<hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 300.) <hi>Where we ſpeak <hi>never ſo poſitively,</hi> ſtill what we deliver is to be lookt upon, not as an abſolute, but as a comparative Hypotheſis.</hi> And ſo not as really founded upon Scripture, and ſupported by it; but as <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> to be ſo only. The Anſwerer therefore, in this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs need not have brought in ſo over-ſtrain'd a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, as <hi>the Articles of our Faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 68.</note> Betwixt which and Hypotheſes, there is greateſt Difference; the one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs than truths of GOD; and the other, no more than Imaginations of men. And as they are very different <hi>things,</hi> ſo Scripture ſupports them very different <hi>ways.</hi> Articles of Faith it ſupports directly, and mainly, by Divine Revelation: Hypotheſes, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally and preſumptively, by humane fiction or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. And as Scripture ſupports them in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner; ſo we are bound to defend them in as different a meaſure. For Articles of Faith we are bound to defend to the very Death; but who are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to be Martyrs for Philoſophy? Yea, ſome who build Hypotheſes upon Scripture-Foundations; I believe will rather let them fall, and moreover help to pull them down; than ſtand a fiery Trial to uphold them. We are told, that S. <hi>Peter convinces</hi> us,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. <hi>85.</hi>
                  </note> that the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt's Deſcription of the Antediluvian Earth, and of the Deluge; is a <hi>reality.</hi> And that other places of Scripture ſeem <hi>manifeſtly</hi> to deſcribe the form of his Abyſs with the Earth above it.<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>86.</hi>

                  <hi>The Church-way of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deluge, is either</hi> rational, <hi>or</hi> irrational. <hi>If he ſay it is</hi> rational, <hi>why does he deſert it, and invent a new one? And if he ſay it is</hi> irrational, <hi>then that dreadful thing, which, <hi>he cannot well endure to ſpeak, That the Church of GOD has ever gone on in an irrational way of explaining the Deluge,</hi> falls flat upon himſelf.</hi> The laſt vital Aſſertion of the Theory, which the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter undertook in his Fifteenth Chapter, is this. <hi>That neither</hi> Noah<hi>'s Flood, nor the preſent form of the Earth, can be explained in any other method that is rational, nor by any other cauſes that are intelligible,</hi> beſides thoſe which the Theory aſſigns. Whence follows (<hi>what I cannot well endure to ſpeak,</hi> ſaid the Excepter,) <hi>that the Church of GOD has ever gone on in <hi>an irrational way</hi> of explaining the Deluge.</hi> Now, ſays the Anſwerer, this charge <hi>falls flat upon himſelf:</hi> and he attempts to prove it, by the Argument produced. But we take it off with this direct and plain Reply.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we ſay, that the Church way of explaining the Deluge is very <hi>rational.</hi> For it implies no more than GOD's creating Waters ſufficient for it, and his annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating them again: which is not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with reaſon or repugnant to it. Tho evident it is, that <hi>his</hi> vital Aſſertion, <hi>expreſsly</hi> condemns this way, in which GOD's Church has ever gone, as both <hi>irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> and <hi>unintelligible</hi> at once. Methinks an excuſe or defence of <hi>this</hi> ſhould have been more ſeaſonable, than
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:51858:87"/> what we here meet with. Unleſs he thinks that ſo black a blemiſh, can be faſtned on the wiſeſt and nobleſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in the whole World, without offence; or means that the Readers Judgment, for his unadviſed raſhneſs ſhould paſs upon him in courſe, by <hi>nihil dicit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we ſay, that we <hi>do not deſert</hi> or reject the Church-way of explaining the Deluge. We allow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as he notes, That it may be <hi>diſguſtful</hi> to the beſt and ſoundeſt <hi>Philoſophic</hi> Judgments:<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>313.</hi>
                  </note> and the reaſons are given, why. But then it is manifeſt, that we ſhut out <hi>Philoſophy</hi> from <hi>ruling</hi> in this Caſe, as being in a good degree <hi>miraculous.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>355.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>The Flood was a</hi> Miracle <hi>in good meaſure. Or had ſo much miracle running through it, and interwoven with it; that all paſſages in it, are not to be accounted for by Reaſon and</hi> Philoſophy. <hi>And truly where</hi> Nature <hi>was over-rul'd by</hi> Providence; <hi>it is but fit that</hi> Philoſophy <hi>ſhould give place to</hi> Omnipotence. And whereas he obſerves, that we ſay, that by our Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>68.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>we are excuſed from running to thoſe Cauſes or Methods, which ſeem unreaſonable to ſome, and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to others, and unſatisfactory to moſt:</hi> This is no proof that the Excepter deſerts the <hi>Churches</hi> way of Explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Deluge. For however <hi>ſome,</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> may think it <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> and <hi>unintelligible,</hi> as the Theoriſt makes it: and how unſatisfactory ſoever <hi>ſome</hi> of the cauſes or methods alledg'd by the Excepter, may be to <hi>moſt:</hi> yet <hi>the</hi> Excepter is of the mind that the Churches me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, is very rational, and eaſy to be underſtood. And tho he farther remarks, that the Excepter ſays, that the ordinary Suppoſition, that the Mountains were covered with water in the Deluge,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>brings on a neceſſity of ſetting up a <hi>new Hypotheſis</hi> for explaining the Flood:</hi> yet that neceſſary <hi>new Hypotheſis,</hi> which the Excepter means, will plainly ſhow, that he <hi>juſtifies</hi> and <hi>defends</hi> the Church-Hypotheſis; inſtead of <hi>deſerting</hi> it. For it is only this.
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:51858:88"/> We muſt ſuppoſe <hi>that the Mountains of <hi>Ararat,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ark reſted in the height of the Deluge, were <hi>then</hi> the higheſt Mountains in the World: but ſince that time they are either worn down, or ſunk and ſettled lower than ſome others.</hi> Admit but this; and then Scripture, Geography, and the Churches method of explaining the Flood, will all be reconcil'd: and the uſual Hypotheſis will ſtand clear of <hi>material</hi> Difficulties and Objections.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſay, that tho we <hi>invented</hi> a new Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis; it was not ſet up in <hi>competition</hi> with this of the <hi>Church,</hi> but in <hi>compariſon</hi> with that of the <hi>Theory,</hi> and in <hi>Confutation</hi> of its <hi>laſt</hi> vital Aſſertion. For it makes it evident, that there is <hi>another</hi> way of explaining <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood, both <hi>rational</hi> in its <hi>method,</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi> in its <hi>cauſes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>300.</hi> l. <hi>18.</hi>
                  </note> at leaſt <hi>as</hi> rational and intelligible as <hi>his.</hi> And as ſuch a <hi>Comparative</hi> Hypotheſis (as we have made it) it may poſſibly ſtand almoſt as long as the Theoriſt's (which draws <hi>more</hi> and <hi>greater</hi> Abſurdities after it.) Eſpecially if it ſhould have but a <hi>Second Edition</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it on the one ſide, and a <hi>Review</hi> to prop it up on the other, and have many things <hi>left out</hi> of it, and have one word in it <hi>explain'd</hi> by another, and have here and there a <hi>Contradiction</hi> allow'd it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter is freed from the objected inconſiſtency with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>This ſame Reply will take off thoſe Objections alſo, which are brought on by the Anſwerer, at the bottom of his ſeventieth Page; as being of near affinity with what he laſt alledged.</p>
               <p>Having thus made his general Obſervations, he comes now to Particulars.

                  <hi>muſt needs raiſe our Curioſity, to ſee that place of Scripture, which has been overlookt by</hi> all the Learned hitherto.

                  <hi>It was in the Tenth month that they</hi> (the Mountains) <hi>begun to be ſeen, when the Waters were decreaſ'd; 'twas therefore the Waters, not the groſs Air, that hindred the ſight of them before.</hi> For if <hi>according to the method of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter, the Deluge begun to decreaſe after the firſt forty days rain,</hi> by the Sun's reſolving <hi>waters into Vapours and Exhalations:</hi> this, <hi>in proportion,</hi> muſt <hi>leſſen the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Deluge. But we do not read in</hi> Moſes <hi>of any abatement in the Deluge, till the end of one hundred and fifty days</hi> (Gen. 8.3.) <hi>which is four Months after this term.</hi> Nor do we imagine that there was any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable</hi> abatement of the Waters till that time. For after the Flood was come to its height, it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it ſhould ſtand there a good while, the better to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that fatal deſtruction of the Animal World, for which it was ſent. Yet during the time that the Flood was thus Stationary, we ſuppoſe that GOD did work no Miracle (for we read of none) to <hi>weaken</hi> Nature in its force, and put by its proper Operations. And ſo the Sun, which had then a <hi>more</hi> than <hi>ordinary</hi> power upon the outragious and prevailing Waters; as ſhining
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:51858:90"/> on them through a <hi>thinner</hi> Medium than ever yet he did; could not but turn them a <hi>great pace</hi> into Miſty Vapours and Exhalations. And theſe aſcending ſwiftly and copiouſly, to repleniſh the Atmoſphaere ſo lately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptied by exceſſive Reſolution; might render the Mountains (as Miſts always do) quite inviſible at a little Diſtance. Yet this work being done only by Nature's hand; or, to uſe the Anſwerer's elegant ſtyle, by <hi>the Sun's ſetting his Engines awork;</hi> tho it was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on for ſeveral Months, the diminution of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſay, might be <hi>inconſiderable.</hi> So inconſiderable, as not to be worth the Spirits notice. And withal ſo ineffectual, that if ſome better courſe had not been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Waters would have remain'd a very long time upon the drowned Earth, beyond the hundred and fifty days mention'd, without any conſiderable degree of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement. For if in the hundred and ten days, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thoſe in which the rains fell, the Waters went up in miſty Vapours (towards reſtoring the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere to its loſt Conſiſtency) in ſuch a quantity as to ſink the Flood ſuppoſe but <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Cubits; tho this reeking evaporation might ſo darken the Air, as to hide the Mountains; yet how little would ſuch a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the Deluge, be taken notice of by Heaven, or how little would it contribute to drying of the Earth? And therefore to ſpeed the work, which by the ſtrength of Nature went on but ſlowly; GOD made uſe of a certain <hi>Wind (Gen.</hi> 8.1.) as an extraordinary Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And by this, added at length to the Attractive influence of the Sun, the Waters aſſwaged ſo very faſt; that as the SPIRIT notes, on the firſt day of the Tenth Month the Tops of the Mountains were ſeen, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.5. And whereas the ſacred Story makes the appearance of theſe Mountain-tops, to follow the decreaſe of the Deluge-waters; nothing could be done more properly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:51858:90"/> according to the tenour of this new Hypotheſis. For in caſe the Waters had not been decreaſed; and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as to have refill'd the Atmoſphaere with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours; and ſo decreaſed, as to have dampt the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive power of the ſun; and ſo decreaſed, as to be drawn ſo low, and grown ſo groſs, and foul, and heavy, as to reſiſt the attenuating force of the Wind aforeſaid: theſe tops of the Mountains could not have ſhown themſelves as yet. For had not the Waters been thus decreaſed, they would ſtill have gone away into Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours and Exhalations at ſuch a rate; as that the air by them would have been ſo bemiſted, and the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains by that would have been ſo obſcured, that the tops of them could not have been ſo ſoon diſcovered. And why the <hi>tops</hi> of them were diſcerned before their <hi>lower</hi> and their larger parts,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>342.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, as to this matter, he objects. <hi>That the whole notion of ſpending the waters of the Deluge by Evaporation hath no foundation in Scripture or Reaſon</hi> But in ſhort, it is founded upon <hi>both.</hi> 1ſt, Upon Reaſon. For how reaſonable is it that Waters ſhould be turned into Vapours; it being a thing moſt natural? And how reaſonable that they ſhould be ſo turned at an <hi>extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary</hi> rate, where the Sun had an extraordinary power; and when to the force of the Sun, was join'd the aſſiſtance of a mighty Wind? 2ly, Upon Scripture. For their Returning <hi>off the Earth continually, Gen.</hi> 8.3. might be but their returning into that <hi>Principle</hi> out of which they were made; namely, into Vapours.<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 340, 341.</note> And that Expreſſion, the <hi>Waters were going and decreaſing, Gen.</hi> 8.5. may be underſtood of their going away quite by a <hi>waſting</hi> or diminiſhing of them. And the learned <hi>Schindler</hi> makes the word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in that very place, to ſignify this very thing. And ſo the Notion was not
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:51858:91"/> only founded upon Scripture, and Reaſon, but more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over upon good Authority. And whereas the Anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer would have the firſt of theſe two cited Texts, to denote the <hi>local motion</hi> of the Waters, or their <hi>returning to the <hi>place</hi> from whence they came;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>76.</hi>
                  </note> this they <hi>did</hi> do when they were reſolved into Vapours, and were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into the Atmoſphaere, whence they deſcended. Tho <hi>ſuch</hi> a Return they could not be ſo <hi>fully</hi> capable of, according to the <hi>Theory</hi>'s Hypotheſis; the inclos'd Abyſs being <hi>fill'd up</hi> in a great meaſure by the fallen Earth. And whereas he ſays farther, that then the <hi>Dove's <hi>returning,</hi>
                  </hi>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.9.</note> and neither <hi>her's,</hi> nor the <hi>Raven's</hi> return into <hi>Eggs,</hi> could have been agreeable to <hi>Nature,</hi> or <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or have been of any manner of <hi>uſe.</hi> Tho as nothing was more <hi>rational,</hi> and nothing more <hi>natural;</hi> ſo nothing could poſſibly be more <hi>uſeful</hi> than the <hi>Evaporation</hi> of the Waters; both to the Earth and Atmoſphaere at once. For by their thus returning, or going away into <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> the one was dried by their reaſcending the other. And ſo whereas he demands, concerning the <hi>Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the Waters, <hi>where does he find this notion in Scripture?</hi> (Anſw. p. 74.) I might better put the like queſtion to <hi>him;</hi> where does he in Scripture find the <hi>vital Aſſertions</hi> of his Theory?

                  </note> It is this. <hi>He gives him</hi> (the Sun) <hi>a <hi>miraculous</hi> power to draw up waters.</hi> But where does he aſcribe ſuch a power to him? The Anſwerer muſt ſhow it, or elſe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:51858:91"/> incur the Cenſure of a falſe Accuſer. Indeed that the Sun has power to exhale Water now, by agitating its Particles, and ſo dilating and putting them into a flying motion; is not to be doubted. Nor is it to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd but this his power of Exhalation was moſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, juſt after the full Riſe of the Deluge. For then the Atmoſphaere having newly ſuffered a thorow Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of its Continuity, and the ſtock of its Vapours being greatly exhauſted; and the whole Earth, except the higher parts of the Mountains, being covered with the Flood; his Beams, having now a freer Paſſage through a finer Air, could not but ſhoot down much more forcibly upon the diffuſed Water, and agitating it more vehemently, make Vapours to riſe at a far greater Rate than they us'd to do. And theſe Vapours being once raiſed by the action of the Sun, would immediately take wing and fly into the empty Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphaere above, there being ſuch room and reception for them. And as faſt as ſome gave way, others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, while the void Atmoſphaere ſuckt them up as it were, and helpt them to aſcend by its readineſs to receive them; an exceſſive plenty of miſty Vapours muſt needs go up, in continued ſtreams, from the ſteaming ſurface of the rarefying Water. Thus, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the Sun had power to draw up Water, and power to attract it <hi>very copiouſly</hi> at the time we ſpeak of, till confuſed Nature came to be reſettled in its firſt Order. Yea, ſo plentifully did he draw up Water in that juncture, and ſuch a miſtineſs thereby did he cauſe in the Air; as he never did do before, nor never (in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood) ſhall do again; becauſe there never was, nor will be the like reaſons for it. But that the Excepter gave him <hi>miraculous</hi> power to do it, is incumbent upon the Anſwerer, who was pleas'd to ſay it, to make it out. A miraculous <hi>Wind</hi> indeed the Excepter owned,<note place="margin">Dſc. p. <hi>341.</hi>

               <p>But beſides all this, at length he would find out an Inſufficiency in the new Hypotheſis; as if the meaſure of its Waters could not reach to the Execution, which was neceſſary to be done upon the Animal World. For whereas an <hi>

                  <hi>I would gladly know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>how this could be in a fifteen-Cubit Deluge. For Birds would naturally fly to the tops of Trees. And Beaſts would retire by degrees to Mountains. Men</hi> alſo <hi>could not fail to retire into Mountains.</hi> Or <hi>the upper ſtories of their houſes might be ſufficient to ſave them.</hi> Or <hi>an houſe ſeated upon an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, or a Caſtle upon a Rock, would always be a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from this diminutive Deluge.</hi>

                     <hi>Ib.</hi> 72.</note> And <hi>thoſe that were upon the Sea, in Ships, would never come in danger.</hi> This is the ſubſtance of the Anſwerers Objections, where he reflects upon the incompetency of the new Hypotheſis, in regard of the Quantity or height of thoſe Waters of which it ſuppoſes the flood to be made. But how eaſily are they taken off? For the common unmountainous Surface of the Earth,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 301.</note> being by neceſſary and providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial contrivance, made inequal: hence it will follow, that when the Waters were <hi>fifteen Cubits</hi> higher than the <hi>higheſt parts</hi> of that <hi>common Surface</hi> (which is the Fundamental Aſſertion of the new Hypotheſis) they might be forty, or fifty, or an hundred, or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cubits higher than the <hi>general ordinary Plain</hi> of the Earth. And when fifteen Cubits Water above the higheſt parts of the Earths common ſurface, would
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:51858:92"/> drown the Level of it generally to ſo prodigious a pitch; inſtead of a <hi>diminutive</hi> (as the Anſwerer calls it) here muſt be a moſt dreadful and deſtructive Deluge, both to Mankind and all Living Creatures. For put caſe that the <hi>Birds,</hi> upon the riſe of the waters, flew unto trees; yet where are the trees whoſe tops are an hundred or two hundred Cubits high? Or ſay, the tops of ſome trees ſtood out of the Waters, as growing upon the <hi>higheſt parts</hi> of the Earth's common Surface: yet could the poor Fowls be able to rooſt there, during the time of the whole forty days Rain; and then on to the end of the Flood? And grant that <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beaſts</hi> retired to the Mountains, when the Waters began to ſwell and threaten them: Yet then they were <hi>great</hi> Mountains to which they betook themſelves, or elſe they were <hi>leſſer</hi> ones. If they were great ones,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. c.</hi> 16. §. 6.</note> they could not run to a more <hi>improper Refuge.</hi> If they were leſſer ones, how could they poſſibly ſubſiſt there, without Shelter or Suſtenance, till the Deluge was drawn off, and the Earth dried up? And the like may be ſaid of thoſe in the <hi>upper Stories</hi> of their houſes. Admit that the Flood did not reach them; yet how could they live there, to come down again at laſt, when their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Stores, in their Cellars <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were all overflowed, and were ſo to continue for a great while? And as for them in <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and <hi>high ſituate Habitations,</hi> if any were ſeated above the Water-mark of the Deluge; how could they ſhift for food and fewel, and keep themſelves from famiſhing for a year together? For either they were well furniſht with Proviſions, or they were not. If they were not, they could not hold out. If they were, it was becauſe a number was to be maintain'd by them. And <hi>many</hi> will as ſoon devour <hi>much;</hi> as a <hi>few</hi> ſpend a <hi>little.</hi> And where is the Caſtle, that being well ſtockt with men, as well us ſtor'd with neceſſaries
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:51858:93"/> (which commonly go together) does not fall into want before a year comes about, where there is no kind of Forage, or proviſionary Recruits? And therefore theſe Caſtles on Rocks, as to the Anſwerer's purpoſe, are but Caſtles in the air: for being on every ſide ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with water, they who were in them would be ſtarved to death. And methinks there is one thing which ſeems to inſinuate, that a good part of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal World might perhaps come to an end thus: By being driven to ſuch ſtreights by the overflowing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as to be <hi>famiſhed</hi> or <hi>ſtarved</hi> to death.

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:51858:93"/> the Sea, by that means, having loſt its Shores, the Mariners skill would be ſtrangely loſt or non-pluſt too.

And <hi>there</hi> being Rocks in great plenty to ſplit them, Hills to ſtave them, Banks to ſtrand them, Buildings to annoy them, Woods and Forreſts to hamper and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle them: their dangers being new, they could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them; and being ſo many, and various, and unexpected, how could they avoid them? And then we muſt conſider farther yet, that <hi>Shipping,</hi> at the Flood, was very far ſhort of that <hi>ſtrength</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which now it has attain'd to.

                  <hi>The Ancients were ignorant of the Divine</hi> (or excellent) <hi>uſe of it.</hi> And ſo does <hi>Blondus,</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Italy. Certum eſt id navigandi auxilium priſcis omnino fuiſſe incognitum:</hi>

                  <hi>Certain it is that help of navigating was altogether unknown to the Ancients. Cardan</hi> alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, <hi>his tribus tota Antiquitas nihil par habet. All Antiquity has nothing equal to theſe three things.</hi> Of which the <hi>Mariners Compaſs</hi> was one, the other two being <hi>Guns,</hi> and <hi>Printing.</hi> And therefore Voyages here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore could be performed only by croſſing over ſome narrow Seas, or elſe by Coaſting it along by the Shores ſide, from one Country to another. And for this reaſon King <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Navy was three years in making a Voyage to <hi>Ophir;</hi> becauſe for lack of the <hi>Compaſs</hi> they were fain to creep along cloſe by the Shores, and durſt not venture to take a ſhorter Cut, by lanching out into the main Ocean. Nor could thoſe Glorious Voyages not long ſince made (as well by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as other Nations) ever have been accompliſht, without the help of this admirable Inſtrument; which yields a
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:51858:98"/> moſt ſtrange direction, and thereby a ſutable ſafety unto Sailors.</p>
               <p>And thus I think enough has been ſaid, to ſhow that the circumſtances of men <hi>in Ships,</hi> at the coming in of the Flood, were not only dangerous but deſperate. For if we conſider aright, that <hi>their</hi> ſhips were much <hi>weaker</hi> than <hi>ours</hi> are; and that thoſe weak Ships had <hi>no Anchors;</hi> and that they themſelves had <hi>no Compaſs;</hi> and that the Seas they navigated had <hi>no Shores,</hi> by which they uſed to ſteer their courſe: And ſo tho they could ſtop no where, yet their motion carry'd them they knew not whither; even amongſt Rocks and Clifts, and Hills, and Mountains, and Cities, and Trees, and Villages. If this, I ſay, be rightly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, we may well conclude their condition hopeleſs. And not only that all <hi>hope</hi> of their being ſaved was taken away, as it was from them in the Ship of <hi>Adramyttium, Acts</hi> 27. but likewiſe all <hi>poſſibility</hi> of their being ſo.</p>
               <p>But if after all, any <hi>hill,</hi> or <hi>Caſtle,</hi> or <hi>houſe,</hi> or <hi>Ship,</hi> could be able to ſave any creatures from the Deluge; we need but flie to <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi> (as the Anſwerer does often) and the power of that would effectually diſpatch them. When Heaven was pleas'd to give <hi>Satan</hi> leave, he cauſed the fire to conſume <hi>Job</hi>'s Sheep, and cauſed the Wind to deſtroy his Children. And how eaſily could thoſe Spirits, that are Miniſters of GOD's vengeance, have made the waters of the Flood (in that terrible day of general execution) fatal to thoſe Creatures that might have eſcap'd them, if any could have done it. For when GOD thinks fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him to the work, there's never a <hi>one</hi> of thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, but really is, (what <hi>Homer</hi> ſo commonly calls <hi>Jupiter</hi>) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a <hi>Gatherer of Clouds.</hi> And ſo with greateſt eaſe, could ſo drive, and thruſt, and ſqueeze them together; as to force them to diſcharge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:51858:98"/> in ſuch mighty Defluxions, as would not fail to drown men, and all Land-animals, in whatever Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities they were lodged.</p>
               <p>And now (as it is high time) let us ſee what the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer ſays, to our notion of <hi>the Fountains of the great Deep.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>303.</hi>
                  </note> They are ſuppoſed to be <hi>Caverns <hi>in Rocks and Mountains.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> And is not that ſufficient to do it? How <hi>many</hi> Truths ſtand upon ſuch ſingle Teſtimonies? nor need they any better evidence to authenticate and confirm them. And 'twere well if every vital Aſſertion of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's, had <hi>one ſingle</hi> text to ſupport it. And yet how eaſie were it to cite ſeveval texts of Scripture, that <hi>fall in</hi> moſt naturally with our ſenſe? I will inſtance but in two. <hi>He layeth up the Deeps in treaſuries, Pſal.</hi> 33.7. And what could theſe <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Treaſuries</hi> be, ſo properly, as huge <hi>Caverns</hi> in Rocks and Mountains; where GOD, by the hand of Nature, did of old, and ſtill does <hi>lay up</hi> Deep Waters? And Pro. 3.20. GOD ſays, <hi>by his knowledge the Depths are broken up,</hi> or <hi>clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> And to what can this Text be applied more fitly, and of what can it be underſtood more fairly, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded more emphatically, than theſe Caverns? Which as they were more generally broke up at the time of the Flood, according as GOD in his Wiſdom thought fit; ſo at certain times, and in certain places, many have been cleaved or opened ſince. Sometimes miraculouſly, as in <hi>Rephidim</hi> and <hi>Cadeſh;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times otherwiſe by ordinary Providence; New Springs breaking forth and running continually out of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened Caverns. Whence as ſome Water iſſued or flowed out? other again was ſtill generated within, by the Reſolution of Vapours drawn up from the Great Deep below, to which the Roots of many high Rocks and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:51858:99"/> Mountains may deſcend. Yea, if they did not go down below the <hi>bottom</hi> of the Deep; how could we come by the Metals that we have? Next he intimates, that the Text we alledge,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> has been <hi>generally underſtood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</hi> And ſo have many Texts which he alledges in favour of his Hypotheſis. And yet he thought that they might be interpreted to <hi>his</hi> ſenſe, and were very applicable to his purpoſe.<note place="margin">Ib.</note> Then he ſays, that <hi>the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter, by all means, will have theſe holes in the Rocks, to be the ſame with the</hi> Moſaical Abyſs, <hi>or Great Deep, that was broken up at the Deluge.</hi> This is a meaning quite beyond our intention: For we mean only this. That our Caverns were but the <hi>fountains</hi> of the great Deep, broken up at the Flood; not the <hi>Great Deep</hi> it ſelf. And this is evident from ſeveral Expreſſions; <hi>three</hi> of which occur in the ſame page where our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is delivered.<note place="margin">303. <hi>li.</hi> 2.</note>

                     <hi>Li.</hi> 1.</note>) <hi>ſuppoſing that the Caverns in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were this great Deep,</hi> &amp;c. And where ſpeaking of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s great <hi>Deeps,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi>'s great <hi>Deep;</hi> it is ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 305. <hi>li.</hi> 30.</note> that <hi>the ſame thing <hi>might be meant by both:</hi>
                  </hi> it is plain that by thoſe <hi>Caverns</hi> and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s <hi>Great Deeps,</hi> muſt be meant, that they were the ſame with the <hi>Fountains</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Tehom Rabbah, or Great Deep; and not that <hi>Great Deep</hi> it ſelf. And whereas it is ſaid
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:51858:99"/> in our <hi>Diſcourſe (p.</hi> 153.) that <hi>the great Deep, or the fountains then broken up, had no relation to the Sea:</hi> it is to be underſtood that they had no ſuch relation to it, as that the breaking them up, ſhould occaſion <hi>the proud waves of the Sea to paſs their bounds in making the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge;</hi> the thing there ſpoken of. And laſtly tho <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s word be <hi>Deep,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s word be, <hi>Deeps;</hi> yet as the different Numbers they uſe, need not ſet them at variance? ſo according to our meaning,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 306.</note> they are very reconcileable. For ſuch Deeps as the Pſalmiſt mentions, were but the <hi>fountains</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Deep; and ſo <hi>in effect</hi> (as was ſaid even now) <hi>but the ſame thing.</hi> As much the ſame, as <hi>fountains</hi> riſing from a Spring-head, and that <hi>Spring-head</hi> can be the ſame. And we may obſerve (in concent with this) that <hi>Moſes</hi> does not ſay that the <hi>Great Deep</hi> was broken up, but that the <hi>Fountains</hi> of the great Deep were ſo. And what <hi>true</hi> Fountains of the Great Deep, were our Caverns of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For the waters that filled them, might all be drawn up (by the influence of the Sun) <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Great Deep; and then when Providence cleaved theſe Caverns, and ſet them a flowing; how properly and really might it be ſaid, that <hi>the Fountains of the Great Deep were broken up?</hi> ſeeing <hi>that</hi> might be the Source, from whence originally the waters of theſe Fountains were extracted. The Anſwerer adds,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> that according to the Excepter, <hi>the</hi> Great Deep <hi>was not one thing, or one continued Cavity, as</hi> Moſes <hi>repreſents it, but ten thouſand holes ſeparate and distant from one another.</hi> Tho our Great Deeps were many, and ſeparate, and diſtant from one another; yet they do not hinder <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Great Deep, from being one continued Cavity: for ours were but the <hi>fountains</hi> of his.

                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 305, 306.</note> where we ſhewed that Scripture does uſe the ſingular and plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:51858:100"/> promiſcuouſly, ſometimes putting one for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Were there not above ten thouſand <hi>Quails</hi> about the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Camp, when they fell round about it as it were two Cubits high?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 11.31.</note> Yet the Scripture ſays only, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and the <hi>Quail</hi> came up, Exod.</hi> 16.13. As if (as many as they were) they had been but <hi>one.</hi> The Anſwerer proceeds; <hi>Neither muſt the Great Deep, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, ſignify a</hi> low place, <hi>but an</hi> high place. <hi>For <hi>he confeſſes theſe Caverns were higher than the common level of the Earth.</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>75.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Great Deep may lie as low as you pleaſe; But <hi>our</hi> Great Deeps were but as <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> of his, and ſo might be as high as we plac'd them. And yet ſome of them might be full out as <hi>deep</hi> as the Sea it ſelf is, in moſt places, if we conſider the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heighth of ſome Mountains. And ſo they might be ſtrangely <hi>vaſt</hi> alſo, conſidering how big ſome Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are. And this our notion of <hi>the Fountains of the Great Deep</hi> falls in moſt fairly with the Scripture Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <hi>Original</hi> of Fountains. For that makes them to come from the <hi>Sea,</hi> or Great Abyſs; and we ſuppoſe ours to be derived from thence. Let theſe things be duly weighed, and I hope it will appear, that the Anſwerer had no reaſon at all to charge us, with breaking thorough <hi>ſo many plain Texts of Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>76.</hi>
                  </note> Will he who finds this great fault, be found free from the like himſelf? But here I appeal to any indifferent Judge, if our Notion of the fountains of the great Deep be not as conſonant to Scripture, as any other.</p>
               <p>And thus we come to his concluding Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Caverns. <hi>What reaſon have we to believe, that there were ſuch Veſſels then,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>77.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>more than now?</hi> To this we have ſpoken ſo very fully,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 306, 307, 308.</note> that nothing more needs here be added in way of reply. Who would have thought there had been ſuch fountains in the Rocks of <hi>Rephidim</hi> and <hi>Cadeſh;</hi> if God had not opened them?
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:51858:100"/> But he draws out the Objection farther, thus.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>77.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>If the opening the Abyſs at the Deluge, had been the opening of Rocks, why did not</hi> Moſes <hi>expreſs it ſo: and tell us, that the Rocks were cloven, and the waters guſhed out; and ſo made the Deluge; This would have been as intelligible if it had been true, as to tell us, that the</hi> Tehom Rabbah <hi>was broken open. But there is not one word of</hi> Rocks, <hi>or the</hi> cleaving of Rocks, <hi>in the Hiſtory of the Flood.</hi> To which we reply, firſt; <hi>Moſes</hi> does not ſay, that the <hi>Tehom Rabbah</hi> was broken open, but only the <hi>fountains</hi> of it were broken up. And what <hi>fountains</hi> belonging to the <hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> could more properly be ſo broken up, than theſe Caverns? Secondly, the <hi>Intelligibility</hi> of a thing, is no reaſon why it muſt needs be expreſſed. How many things are paſſed by with ſilence in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, even where occaſion is offered to ſpeak of them; which yet are true, and had they been expreſſed, might eaſily have been underſtood? And thirdly, the ſame Objection which he throws at the Excepter; rebounds back with violence upon himſelf. If the breaking up of the Abyſs, at the Deluge, had been <hi>the Diſruption and fall of the Earth into the Abyſs which lay under it</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Vital Aſſertion of the Theory, in that caſe;) why did not <hi>Moſes</hi> expreſs it ſo: and tell us that this <hi>Diſruption</hi> and <hi>Fall of the Earth into the Abyſs which lay under it,</hi> made the Deluge? This would have been as intelligible, if it had been true, as to tell us that the <hi>Fountains of the Jehom Rabbah were broken up.</hi> But there is not one word of this <hi>Fall of the Earth,</hi> in the Hiſtory of the Flood.</p>
               <p>Thus have we ſeen the Aſſaults that are made upon the new Hypotheſis for the Explication of the Deluge: But ſo far are they from overthrowing it, that they ſeem to me, not to ſhake it in the leaſt. And I cannot but own, that I am never ſo inclinable to believe it may be
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:51858:101"/> true, as when I conſider how weak the anſwers are to the reaſons and arguments alledg'd to confirm it; and how inconſiderable the Objections againſt it. But yet I do no more affirm it to be true <hi>now,</hi> than I did at <hi>firſt.</hi> Tho I am apt to think it may as well paſs for true, and may as eaſily be maintained to be true, as that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis to which it is compared, and which arrogates to it ſelf, the glorious Title, not only of a <hi>true <hi>piece of Natural Hiſtory;</hi>
                  </hi> but alſo of <hi>the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,</hi> that hath yet been <hi>ſince the beginning of the World.</hi>

               <p>THE principal matter, and the only thing to be noted in this Chapter; is what our Author omitted in its proper place, and is here thought on by him to be anſwered. According to his uſual way of miſtaking,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>78.</hi>
                  </note> he calls it <hi>one objection,</hi> tho there be <hi>two</hi> very diſtinct ones. He anſwers the laſt firſt, and therefore I begin with that,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>311.</hi>
                  </note> which was this. <hi>If the Abyſs under the Earth</hi> (to wave the other things mention'd) <hi>had been the great Deep meant by</hi> Moſes; <hi>it had not had any <hi>true</hi> or <hi>proper Fountains</hi> in it.</hi> And ſo what will become of <hi>all the Fountains <hi>of the great Deep?</hi>
                  </hi> His Anſwer is,<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>78.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>there were fountains in the Abyſs, as much as Windows in Heaven.</hi> The word, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, rendred, <hi>Windows;</hi> ſignifies as well, <hi>Cataracts;</hi> and it might have been rendred ſo more properly. And indeed in the Margent, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. it is rendred, <hi>Floodgates;</hi> which in ſignification is ſomewhat nearer to, <hi>Cataracts</hi> Tho <hi>that,</hi> I ſay, would have been the <hi>propereſt</hi> reddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Text. For <hi>Cataracts</hi> are high and broken places, from whence waters do impetuouſly ruſh down. And therefore thick, and broken Clouds, condenſed
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:51858:101"/> into hardneſs or an Icy conſiſtency, from which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious waters, (by falls from one concameration of them to another) came tumbling down in exceſſive quantities, and at laſt were diſcharged hideouſly on the Earth, in many places, eſpecially about the lofty Mountains; were at that time <hi>true coeleſtial Cataracts,</hi> which by ALMIGHTY GOD were then <hi>opened</hi> even in a literal ſenſe. And therefore theſe Cataracts (or <hi>Windows of Heaven</hi>) by ſome learned Commentators, are expounded to be, <hi>Nubes denſae &amp; Copioſae; thick and huge Clouds.</hi> But now in the inclos'd Abyſs, there were no <hi>anſwerable</hi> Fountains broken up; no ſuch <hi>real</hi> Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, as theſe were <hi>real <hi>Cataracts of Heaven:</hi>
                  </hi> and therefore the Anſwer given, is not home to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The other Objection was this. Whereas it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Diſc. p. <hi>311.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.2. <hi>That</hi> the Fountains of the Deep were ſtopped: <hi>the Earth broken down into the Abyſs was never</hi> made up <hi>again.</hi> He anſwers; <hi>thoſe were ſhut up; that is,</hi>

                  <hi>ceas'd to act, and were put into a condition to continue the Deluge no longer.</hi> But then if the <hi>Stoppage</hi> of theſe Fountains was <hi>Figurative,</hi> the Fountains themſelves muſt be the ſame. And ſo they were not ſo <hi>real</hi> as the Cataracts of Heaven were. Nor could they be <hi>ſtopped</hi> ſo <hi>properly</hi> as our Caverns might be: the thing that we argued for, and the drift of our Objection was to make it out.

                  <hi>'Tis eaſieſt of all to deceive ones ſelf; For that which every one wills, he phantſies,</hi> is: <hi>But the nature of things is often otherwiſe.</hi> The eloquent Man gave this hint in <hi>another</hi> Caſe: but it is not inapplicable to <hi>that</hi> in hand. Our Anſwerer believes his Theory to be true. But may he not here practiſe that upon himſelf, which is ſo eaſie to be done? The Man that would fain have a thing be real, will ſoon believe it is ſo; ſtrong incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being equivalent to evidence. And (which we may well wonder at) as one ſymptom of the ſtrong faith he has for his Hypotheſis; he declares, that his believing his Theory to be <hi>no more than a Romance or phantastical Idea,</hi> would be <hi>both to bely his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to mock the World.</hi> Now in ſhort, if his Theory be <hi>not</hi> true, it is but a <hi>Romance</hi> or <hi>phantaſtic Idea.</hi> And if it <hi>be</hi> true, I ſpeak it with reverence, the HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY GHOST, the SPIRIT of truth, muſt be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:51858:102"/> ſo; and GOD did moſt certainly <hi>mock the World,</hi> the thing which our Anſwerer is aſham'd to do. For He granted to <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Off-ſpring, a <hi>Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea,</hi> as well as over the Fowls of the Air, and the Beaſts of the Earth: and the H. GHOST recorded as much, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. But when GOD paſſed that Grant to <hi>Adam</hi> and his Poſterity; if there was no Sea nor Fiſh, for him, or them, to command, or come at, in the Primitive Earth; muſt not this be down right <hi>Mocking</hi> of the firſt World? And yet if he did <hi>not</hi> paſs that Grant, the H. GHOST, for recording it <hi>done,</hi> muſt be as was ſaid, and what I love not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat. Tho at laſt this Grant could never paſs and take place, unleſs the Theory be a <hi>Romance</hi> and <hi>phantaſtic Idea.</hi> For it aſſerts expreſly of the firſt Earth, that it was <hi>without a Sea.</hi> Yea, this is put amongſt its <hi>Vital</hi> aſſertions, and therefore if it fails, the Theory <hi>dies,</hi> and the whole Hypotheſis is ruin'd at once. But how much better is it, that this <hi>piece of Natural Hiſtory</hi> (as <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> and <hi>remarkable</hi> as it is, in its Authors eſteem) ſhould prove a <hi>Romance;</hi> than that any piece of the <hi>Divine Hiſtory</hi> ſhould prove an untruth; and the H. GHOST, and the HOLY GOD ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to do ſuch unworthy things, as would mightily diſgrace any honeſt man. The next Paſſage that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to notice, is this.<note place="margin">Ib:</note> 
                  <hi>I remember I have heard a good Author once wiſh, that there were an</hi> Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>that whoever Printed a Book, ſhould, when he took a Licenſe, ſwear, that he thought the</hi> Contents of his Book to be true, <hi>as to the ſubſtance. And I think ſuch a method would keep off a great many impertinencies.</hi> Had our Honourable Senate a power to over-rule the minds of men, and to enact that none ſhould <hi>think</hi> things true, which in themſelves are falſe; I doubt not but they would ſoon ſecure us by Law, from erroneous imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:51858:103"/> But ſo long as Authors can <hi>believe</hi> their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and <hi>think</hi> them <hi>true;</hi> when if they <hi>be</hi> ſo, even in the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of them, the Word from Heaven muſt be falſe: There is little hope that the wiſhed <hi>Act</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſuch an Oath, ſhould be an effectual Expedient. However it might keep off <hi>ſome</hi> impertinent errors, <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> would come on; and the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt remarkable Natural Hiſtory,</hi> would have been a proof and pregnant exemplification of as much; had ſuch an <hi>Act</hi> been paſſed.</p>
               <p>After this, he compares his own <hi>Poſitiveneſs,</hi> with my <hi>Partiality:</hi> Wiſhing the Excepter had not more to <hi>anſwer for,</hi> as to that; than the Theoriſt hath for the other. Here I am moſt ready to <hi>join Iſſue</hi> with him, and to go to Trial immediately at any Bar. And let the Judge be even who he will, ſo he be no more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, than the Excepter has been. Then I ſhall fear neither his Examination, nor yet his Sentence: let the one be as ſtrict, and the other as ſevere, as Juſtice can make them. Then he comes upon us with a double charge,<note place="margin">Ib.</note> as if we had fail'd in the <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and alſo in the <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> which we promiſed to uſe. But 'tis a ſign he wants matter for accuſation, when he is fain to make theſe things Inſtances of it. As to failing in <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> tho the charge be heavy; the Proofs of it (for our comfort) are light enough. For they are only <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and partial Citations;</hi> and our <hi>not taking notice of the laſt Edition of the Theory:</hi> to which we have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently anſwered already, that is, in the laſt Paragraph ſave one, of the ſeventh Chapter of this Reply. But his purſuing us thus with this clamour, of our <hi>not taking notice of his laſt Edition;</hi> minds me of what a certain Friend did once ſuggeſt. Who obſerving how many <hi>particulars</hi> were <hi>left out</hi> of that Edition, which were cenſured in my <hi>Exceptions;</hi> and underſtanding that thoſe <hi>Exceptions</hi> in writing, were about the Town
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:51858:103"/> (where at laſt they were printed) for above a year and half together at one time, long before his Edition came forth: would fain perſwade me, that during that time, my Exceptions ſtraggled into the Theoriſt's hands; or that by one or other he was made <hi>acquainted</hi> with them; and ſo ſhifted as many of his Errors as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently could, out of the way, as being ſenſible they could not bear that blow, which he foreſaw was coming. Our want of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> is a new crimination; and he proves it by this <hi>fierce Charge,</hi> as he calls it, in our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi> The <hi>Theoriſt hath aſſaulted Religion, and that in the very foundation of it.</hi> If any thing like <hi>fierceneſs</hi> can be found here; it muſt be <hi>forced</hi> out of the <hi>form</hi> of the words. And <hi>that,</hi> I do declare, is not owing in the leaſt to any heat of Spirit; but meerly to the <hi>real truth</hi> of the Matter, which in other terms, could not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter expreſt. For I hope it will be granted, that holy Scripture is the <hi>Foundation</hi> of our Religion. And then, of neceſſity, <hi>Contradicting</hi> Scripture, muſt be <hi>aſſaulting</hi> that Foundation. And there was no more of Fierceneſs, (let him aſſure himſelf,) than there is of Falſeneſs, in our Aſſertion. But I plainly ſee, that he who touches a Sore, tho with greateſt tenderneſs, and with no other intention than purely to heal it; muſt have hard words, as well as heavy complaints, from the Party affected. But this charge, it ſeems, ran too high. For <hi>here,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib.</note> ſays he, <hi>I expected to have found two or three Articles of the Creed aſſaulted or knockt down by the Theory.</hi> I muſt tell him freely (and I do it meekly) that contradicting Scripture (the burthen of our charge) is the readieſt way not only to knock down <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three;</hi> but even <hi>all</hi> the Articles of the Creed at once. Undermining the Foundation, muſt needs ſink the whole Building. But what courſe does the Doctor take, to free himſelf from this Charge; which becauſe it lies <hi>juſtly</hi> againſt him,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:51858:104"/> lies <hi>heavy</hi> upon him? Why, he makes Two faint Offers at removing it.<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>81.</hi>
                  </note> The firſt is this. <hi>Let us remember, that this contradicting Scripture, here pretended, is only in natural things.</hi> And is his contradicting Scripture then, but <hi>pretended</hi> only? I heartily wiſh, for his ſake, that it were ſo. But what is ſaid in the Eighth Chapter of this Reply, makes it <hi>too real</hi> and <hi>apparent.</hi> To extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate it therefore, he here <hi>remembers us,</hi> that his contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting Scripture, <hi>is only in natural things.</hi> And now I muſt confeſs my ſelf to be at a ſtand. I have often been ſurpriz'd at occurrencies in his Writings; but now I am almoſt amaz'd: To ſee that ſo wild a word as this, ſhould come from the Pen of a Chriſtian Doctor. That he ſhould alledge for himſelf, as a kind of defence, that he contradicted Scripture <hi>only in natural things.</hi> As if when the H. SPIRIT ſpake of <hi>ſuch</hi> things, he did not mind what it was he ſaid; or men might interpret it even as they liſt, and turn it to a contrary meaning if they pleaſe, without offence. As if it were lawful in ſome things to give GOD the lie, ſo we but allow him to ſpeak truth in others. Believe it, I take no pleaſure at all in theſe expreſſions; but yet I cannot forbear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to think the Oracles of Heaven ſhould be thus treated. I formerly minded him of <hi>too bold an affront to Scripture,</hi> and how he might approach towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enormity: and, GOD knows, I did it in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and kindneſs. And however it was taken, 'tis now plain,<note place="margin">81.</note> it was neceſſary. For in that very page where he reflects on thoſe things; he runs unhappily into this <hi>new</hi> exorbitance, of excuſing his <hi>contradicting</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by ſaying he did it <hi>only in natural things.</hi> As he bids <hi>us <hi>remember</hi>
                  </hi> this, ſo I hope <hi>he</hi> will remember it <hi>ſeriouſly.</hi> Elſe by the memento he here puts in, he will but heat a Brand as it were, to mark himſelf for extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance. And truly admit but this <hi>one</hi> Extravagance
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:51858:104"/> of <hi>contradicting Scripture</hi> in <hi>natural</hi> things: and it will draw ſuch a <hi>number</hi> of <hi>others</hi> after it, and thoſe ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; that no tongue can be able either to reckon them up, or repreſent them. It would even match the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> that <hi>Hydra</hi> of non-ſenſical errors, and monſtrous Jargon of abſurdities. As a ſpecimen of this, take what follows. From the very beginning, as Scripture aſſures us, the Sun ſhone in the Heavens; the Light filled the Air; and Day and Night were alternately on the Earth. But theſe were <hi>Natural things;</hi> and may we venture therefore to contradict Scripture in them, and ſay they were not ſo? Then how could the World poſſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt? As Scripture informs us, the Ground yielded trees, and trees brought forth fruits, and of one ſort of fruit did our firſt Parents eat (tho it was forbidden them.) But theſe were <hi>Natural things;</hi> and may we therefore preſume to contradict Scripture, and deny that they were thus? Then how came theſe Products into being, which gave occaſion to the ſin and fall of man? As Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture inſtructs us, <hi>Adam</hi> begat ſome Children, and they begat others, and they again others, and ſo on. But theſe Generations were <hi>Natural things;</hi> and may we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take upon us to contradict Scripture, and ſay there was no ſuch way of propagation? Then how could Mankind be increas'd and multipli'd? As Scripture teaches us, the Body of our LORD was fleſh and blood. But fleſh and blood are <hi>Natural things;</hi> and may we therefore be ſo bold as to contradict Scripture, and ſay that his body was not carnal? Then how can his blood cleanſe us from our ſins? or how ſhall we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſaved by his Croſs? And when to ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and miſchievous pitch of abſurdity, <hi>contradicting Scripture in <hi>Natural</hi> things,</hi> would riſe; this aloud pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it to be an evil practice, and a method too licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:51858:105"/> to be allowable. And farther; <hi>Natural</hi> things may be <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>divine Declarations</hi> and <hi>Promiſes</hi> in Scripture. And when they are ſo, to contradict Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by ſaying they are <hi>otherwiſe</hi> than that <hi>declares</hi> or <hi>promiſes</hi> they ſhould be; muſt be indirect impeachment of the Truth, Fidelity, and Righteouſneſs of Heaven. Thus, for example, it was of old <hi>declar'd</hi> or <hi>promis'd</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> that <hi>while the Earth continueth, ſeed-time, and harveſt, and ſummer, and winter, ſhall not ceaſe, Gen.</hi> 8.22. But therefore ſhould we ſay that theſe various Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall not be conſtant, and run parallel with this Earthly Worlds exiſtence; but ſhall either be ſuſpended by diſcontinuance or interruption; or elſe ceaſe by prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature abolition or expiration: by contradicting Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in theſe tempeſtival <hi>Natural</hi> Viciſſitudes, we ſhould break in too rudely upon GOD's moſt glorious Attributes aforeſaid. We may very eaſily bring this home, to the <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Fiſh of the Sea. That was a Priviledge which GOD <hi>declared</hi> or <hi>promiſed</hi> ſhould be <hi>Adam</hi>'s. He therefore that denies the being of a Sea, till long after his death; by contradicting Scripture in a <hi>Natural thing,</hi> muſt reflect diſhonourably upon that GOD, <hi>Who keepeth truth for ever, Pſal.</hi> 146.6. In ſpite of this his Character (which I would not ſhould fail for ten thouſand Worlds) he makes him at once to be falſe to his Word, unfaithful to his Promiſe, and unjuſt to his Creature. But as He that is <hi>righteous in all his Ways,</hi> muſt needs abhor to <hi>be</hi> thus; ſo we muſt abhor to <hi>think</hi> it of him. And farther yet; ſhould GOD evidently violate, but <hi>one</hi> expreſs <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Promiſe</hi> he has made, tho in <hi>Natural things;</hi> what a Damp would it caſt upon mens belief of him in <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Concerns? What a jealouſy might it raiſe, and what a vehement ſuſpicion might it juſtly create in them, as to all his higheſt <hi>promiſſory</hi> engagements; making
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:51858:105"/> them apt to queſtion whether he would ſtand to any, if not ready to conclude that he would keep none. And thus again the evil, of contradicting Scripture, in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things,</hi> will diſcover it ſelf. He was pleas'd to ſignify, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. that <hi>the ſeed of the Woman</hi> ſhould bruiſe the Serpents head. Of how high a Nature, and of what infinite Conſequence, was this moſt gracious <hi>Declaration</hi> or <hi>Promiſe?</hi> It was the authentic Patent of Heavens renewed kindneſs to Sinners; and the grand Aſſurance the Praediluvians had, of its Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal favours. But if <hi>Adam</hi> and his Children of the firſt world, had found by experience, that the GOD who made it, could break faith with men; why ſhould they regard it? And what convincing experience had they of this, if when he <hi>promis'd</hi> the <hi>Dominion over Sea-fiſh</hi> to them, he did ſo grievouſly tantalize and abuſe them, as to hide both the Sea, and all its Fiſh from them, to the end of that World? Manifeſt it is, that He aſſur'd the Inhabitants of the primitive World, as <hi>much</hi> of <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Sea; as he did of the <hi>benefit</hi> of an incarnate Saviour: but then if he cheated them ſo egregiouſly at preſent, how could they in prudence truſt him for the future; and take his word to be what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſtyles it, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the word of righteouſneſs, Pſal.</hi> 119.123? or as ſome render it (and not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) the word of <hi>bounty,</hi> or <hi>kindneſs.</hi> Fraudulent dealing makes Confidence ſhie; and they that have been chous'd, will be cautelous after it. If one ſays he will give me but <hi>two Guineas,</hi> and baſely deceives me; when he tells me he deſigns a thouſand for me, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I muſt think he puts a trick upon me. So if GOD brake promiſe with the Antediluvians, in a leſſer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; how could they expect he ſhould perform a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? His unfair diſappointing them of a temporal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; would rather have flung them into fatal deſpair
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:51858:106"/> of his everlaſting Mercy. His impoſing on them ſo openly once, would have aw'd their faith into ſuch fear and diffidence: that they could no more have reli'd upon his broken fidelity. No more than they could believe, that he made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> to be Lords of the Fiſh, and Soveraigns of the Sea; when neither he nor they, ſaw one or the other, to their dying day. And thus for the Credit of <hi>contradicting</hi> Scripture in <hi>Natural things,</hi> we ſee what the tendency of it is, and how excellent the products of it will be. It turns the moſt ſolemn Grants of Heaven, into ſhameful Mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and beſides the diſhonour it brings to GOD, lets in fatal deſpondency upon men. So much for the firſt piece of his apology: the ſecond part of it follows.</p>
               <p>And here in way of farther anſwer to the Charge of contradicting Scripture;<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>81.</hi>
                  </note> he is diſpos'd to <hi>obſerve, how far the Excepter himſelf, in ſuch</hi> (natural) <hi>things, hath contradicted Scripture.</hi> And becauſe the Excepter us'd <hi>dreadful Sentences</hi> towards the Theoriſt, he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſhow, that he hath <hi>made <hi>himſelf</hi> obnoxious to them:</hi> And that this might be done the more fairly, we <hi>muſt</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſtate the caſe truly.</hi> And he does it thus. <hi>Whether to go contrary to the letter of Scripture, in things that relate to the Natural World,</hi>

                  <hi>be deſtroying the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Religion; affronting Scripture; and blaſpheming the H. GHOST.</hi> Now however he pretends to ſtate this caſe <hi>truly;</hi> it is evident that he does it <hi>falſly.</hi> For it is not going contrary to the <hi>letter</hi> of Scripture, that draws ſuch evil conſequences after it; but going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the letter of Scripture, where it is to be <hi>lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> underſtood. This Circumſtance therefore (which was left out) ſhould have been taken into the Caſe. And this is the great overſight of the Theoriſt; going contrary to Scripture in Natural things, where it is to be <hi>taken</hi> in a <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe. By this means he expoſeth
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:51858:106"/> himſelf. But the Excepter is guilty of no ſuch proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, and therefore the Scriptures alledg'd againſt him, can take no hold of him. In demonſtration of as much, let us but conſider the <hi>firſt</hi> of them, that he cites in his Anſwer, which is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.5.<note place="margin">Ib.</note> The whole verſe runs thus, being ſpoken by <hi>David,</hi> of the Sun. <hi>Which is as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber, and rejoyceth, as a ſtrong man, to run a race.</hi> So that according to the letter of this Text, the Sun <hi>moves.</hi> But ſays the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer, <hi>the Sun ſtands ſtill, and the Earth moves,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib.</note> 
                  <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to</hi> the Excepter's <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Very true. But yet that Doctrine is not contrary to this Scripture, for the reaſon juſt now ſuggeſted; even becauſe its <hi>meaning</hi> is not <hi>literal.</hi> For which reaſon alſo the alledging it is improper and inſignificant. And that its meaning can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be literal, it proves irrafragably for its ſelf. For take it in <hi>that</hi> ſenſe, and what a numerous throng of ridiculous Abſurdities, will iſſue from it upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception? Then the Sun muſt be a man, and muſt be upon his Marriage, and muſt be dreſt in fine clothes, as a Bridegroom is. Then he muſt come out of a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and muſt give no more light, and caſt no more heat, than a Bridegroom does. Then he muſt have life too, and he muſt have ſenſe; he muſt have paſſions, and he muſt have leggs; elſe how can he rejoyce, and rejoice, as a ſtrong man, to run a race? So that, in ſhort, what is here ſaid of the Sun's <hi>motion,</hi> needs not be <hi>literally</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood. It may be ſpoken only <hi>quoad apparentiam</hi> vel ad <hi>captum vulgi:</hi> according to appearance, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon apprehenſion. And the like may be ſaid of the reſt of thoſe Scriptures, which the Anſwer quotes to the ſame purpoſe, either in the Body, or the Margent of it. What therefore was <hi>ſaid</hi> before, we may <hi>think</hi> ſtill; that the alledging this Text was improper and ſuperfluous. And the Anſwerer himſelf confirms this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:51858:107"/> thought. For he ſays (<hi>p.</hi> 85.) that <hi>we all leave the literal ſenſe in certain caſes, and therefore that alone is no ſufficient charge against any man.</hi> And thus he is ſo kind or complaiſant, as to cenſure and take off his own Objection; and to ſave us the trouble of confuting his Argument, by baffling it himſelf. And which is kinder yet, he tells us (<hi>p.</hi> 84.) <hi>the truth is, if we ſhould follow the Vulgar ſtyle, and literal ſenſe of Scripture, we muſt renounce Philoſophy and natural Experience.</hi> And ſo by a pretty and unuſual ſort of method, the skain which he ruffled, he brings to rights again. Firſt he obſerv'd that we <hi>contradicted</hi> Scripture. Then he ſhow'd <hi>wherein</hi> we did it. Then he <hi>charg'd</hi> us for ſo doing. Then he proclaim'd his Charge <hi>inſufficient.</hi> And laſtly he <hi>allows</hi> the very thing he attaqu'd. For he makes it neceſſary to contradict Scripture in ſome Caſes, and not to follow its literal ſence in all things; Unleſs we will renounce Philoſophy and Experience. A thing which the Excepter is loth to do. As to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he brings, of the Sun's raiſing Mountains, and the Moon's hindring the formation of the Earth: they are ſo far from being Arguments againſt the Excepter, that they are but meer <hi>miſtakes</hi> of his own, as we have here ſhewed. But another Argument he has found out (tho by an odd way of invention) or muſtered up to bring up the Rear,<note place="margin">Chap. 3d. and 10th.</note> in this Battalion. And by it he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make an abſolute conqueſt of us, and to beat us down into humble ſubjection to his own ſentiment: in which he thus triumphs over us, tho before the Victory.<note place="margin">Anſw. p. <hi>82.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>This, I think, is <hi>truly</hi> to contradict Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Here therefore, I trow, he goes upon good grounds and treads ſure. For ſhould his heels fly up, as they have frequently done, his fall would be the worſe, for running ſo high againſt his adverſary; as he calls the Excepter, in the foregoing Paragraph. And pray,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:51858:107"/> what is this laſt Argument? Why, <hi>the Excepter, in his new Hypotheſis, makes the Waters of the Deluge, to be but fifteen Cubits higher than the Plain or common ſurface of the Earth, Which Scripture affirms <hi>expreſsly,</hi> to have covered the <hi>tops</hi> of the higheſt hills.</hi> And again he vouches it; <hi>The Scripture ſays, they covered the <hi>tops</hi> of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Mountains.</hi> But this the Scripture does <hi>not</hi> do.

And thus his ill fortune haunts him ſtill; and where he thought to have catcht his adverſary in a Net? he only hampers and intangles himſelf.

Yet he twice together aſſerts it did;<note place="margin">Two Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truths.</note> and ſo his recidivation is <hi>double,</hi> and <hi>two</hi> untruths he tells at once. 'Tis confeſt Scripture ſays, that the Mountains, at the Flood, were <hi>covered</hi> with waters. But ſo it ſays alſo (as we have obſerved) that the Camp of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the Wilderneſs, was <hi>covered</hi> with Quails. But as Quails, two Cubits high upon the ground, could not cover the <hi>Tops</hi> of the higheſt Tents; ſo Waters fifteen Cubits high upon the Earth, might not cover the <hi>Tops</hi> of the higheſt Hills. For certain Scripture does not <hi>ſay,</hi> it does not <hi>affirm <hi>expreſsly</hi>
                  </hi> that they did. Yet by this, the Gentleman gives us to underſtand, that what the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture <hi>ſays,</hi> and <hi>expreſsly affirms;</hi> is to be believed, and ought to be received. And then why is the being of <hi>a Sea,</hi> before the Flood rejected, and <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>dominion</hi> over its fiſh denied?

Sound Philoſophy is a noble thing; and let all advance in it as far as they can: the more expert Philoſophers they are, the wiſer and better they are like to be. But ſtill we muſt remember, that true Philoſophy being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> muſt never interfere with <hi>Revelation.</hi> As on the one ſide, it ſhould not be ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? ſo on the other ſide, it muſt not be pragmatical. Scripture is no enemy to Philoſophy; and Philoſophy by no means muſt affront Scripture. GOD allows men the <hi>freeſt</hi> uſe of their Reaſon; but 'tis unreaſonable they ſhould oppoſe it to Inſpiration; and by uſing it confront his authority who gave them it. So concern'd

Direct the addreſs to the <hi>One</hi> True GOD, and there can be no fault in its application. And let Notions be ſquar'd by the Rules that it contains, and then Philoſophy may take its liberty. Scripture allows it ſufficient latitude, and the Chriſtian Church will do no leſs. So I am ſure ſhe did of old. For then in her earlier and purer times, ſhe was ſo far from diſcouraging Philoſophy, that ſhe took mens paſſing through its Schools, to be a laudable preparative or qualification for their preferment.

And if we would not ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate our account here, we muſt take heed of one thing: Of entertaining Philoſophy with trifling Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For if once we ſuffer it to ſeed upon ſuch traſh, we may expect it will ſoon get a ſurfeit, and fall ſick of Phantſy; and that's a Diſeaſe which commonly riſes up into paroxyſms of extravagance. And then the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal heat of reaſon, as I may call it, turns into a violent and raging Fever.

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the whole, you ſee, it is no fault to recede from the literal ſence of Scripture, but the fault is when we leave it without a juſt cauſe. As it is no fault for a man to ſeparate from a Church:— but to do it without a juſt cauſe, is a real fault.</hi> The beginning of this Obſervation does ſtill farther juſtifie us, againſt his late <hi>inſufficient Charge.</hi> And the reſt of it gives us occaſion to enquire, what <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> he had <hi>to recede</hi> from the <hi>literal ſence of Scripture,</hi> as in too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he has done. For if he left that ſence <hi>without</hi> juſt: cauſe, he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, condemn'd by a ſentence out of his own mouth. The Letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly ſays, that GOD made two <hi>great Lights:</hi> that He gave <hi>Adam <hi>Dominion</hi>
                  </hi> over the <hi>Fiſh of the Sea:</hi> that <hi>Tubal Cain,</hi> was an Inſtructer of every Artificer in <hi>Braſs and Iron:</hi> That the Fountains of the Great Deep were broken up, and the Windows of Heaven open'd, <hi>the ſame day.</hi> Now, pray, what good reaſon, or what <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> is there for his departing from the Literal ſence of Scripture in theſe things? For to recede from it <hi>without</hi> Cauſe, is as <hi>real</hi> a fault, by his own confeſſion; as it is, without cauſe to ſeparate from a Church. And therefore as cauſleſs ſeparation from a Church, is criminous Schiſm; ſo cauſeleſs receſſion from that ſence of Scripture, muſt be culpable deſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſo if any Writer knowingly and cauſeleſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts the literal ſence of Scripture or diſſents from it; he cannot be innocent. For to uſe the Anſwerers own words,<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>85.</hi>
                  </note> tho <hi>we all leave the literal ſence in certain caſes, and therefore that alone is no ſufficient charge againſt any man: Yet he that makes a ſeparation, if I may ſo call it, without good reaſons, he is <hi>truly obnoxious to cenſure.</hi>
                  </hi> And ſo, in ſhort, he becomes his own Judge, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a moſt juſt ſentence on himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ib.</note>And thus he comes to the <hi>great reſult of all</hi> which <hi>is
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:51858:109"/> this. To have ſome common Rule to direct us, when every one ought to follow, and when to leave the Literal Sence.</hi> And ſuch a Rule, it ſeems, is not wanting. For as he tells us in the next words, That Rule which is generally agreed upon by good Interpreters, is this. <hi>Not to leave the literal ſence, when the ſubject matter will bear it, without abſurdity or incongruity.</hi> But muſt not the knowledge then of this good Rule, aggravate the <hi>breaking</hi> it? Ignorance, which ſometimes excuſes error, does always extenuate it. But if with open eyes we go againſt the light, and ſwerve from the Rule we ſee ſtanding before us; our ſenſes take from us all plea of overſight, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous enormity will admit of little or no apology. But yet the Anſwerer offers ſomewhat to clear <hi>him</hi> in this matter; and it follows immediately in the next words. <hi>This Rule I have always propoſed to my ſelf, and always endeavoured to keep cloſe to it.</hi> May his next <hi>propoſal</hi> then, and <hi>endeavour</hi> of this nature, be more fortunate. And to that end perhaps it may be proper they ſhould be better inforced. For muſt not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal here be too ſlight, and muſt not his endeavour be too faint, when both of them proved ſo inſucceſsful? For had the one been as ſerious, and the other as vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as it ought; what could have defeated him, in ſo juſt an Enterpriſe, or diverted him from it? For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; had he really propoſed, and heartily endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep cloſe to the letter, where Scripture ſays, GOD made <hi>two great Lights;</hi> or where it ſays, he gave <hi>Adam Dominion</hi> over Sea-fiſh; or the like; what could have hindred him, or beat him off it? As for <hi>abſurditys</hi> or <hi>incongruitys</hi> in the <hi>ſubject Matters</hi> (the only Bar (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule) which can exclude that ſence) nothing can be more vain than to pretend any here. For as we have plainly ſeen, the readieſt way to open a wide Door, and let <hi>them</hi> in, is to <hi>receede</hi> from the literal
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:51858:110"/> ſence. 'Tis confeſt indeed, that the literal ſence, in theſe, and other caſes, would have brought in abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inconveniencies upon the <hi>Theory,</hi> in good plenty. But then this is ſo far from being any reaſon, why the literal ſence of thoſe places ſhould not be received; that it is a moſt clear and convincing Argument, that <hi>that Hypotheſis</hi> is to be rejected. For by the Rule laid down, I ſay, where no kind of abſurdities or incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys do accrue to any Texts, from the literal ſence; there it muſt be kept to. And therefore if the Theory cannot ſtand, and maintain it ſelf free from abſurdities and incongruities, without perverting or depraving the literal ſence of the now cited Texts, or any other; and without cauſing a needleſs departure from it: it muſt ſink and fall. And then (as he ſomewhere interrogates the Excepter) <hi>why does he trouble himſelf,</hi>

                  </note> Did he do it <hi>meerly out of an itch of Scripturiency,</hi> as he ſpeaks; methinks he might have laid that prurient humour, by ſcratching himſelf with the briars of a more innocent Controverſie; or by ſcrubbing ſoundly againſt ſomething elſe than the holy Scripture.<note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>85.</hi>
                  </note> He goes on. <hi>But ſome inconſiderate minds make every departure from the letter, let the Matter or Cauſe be what it will, to be an affront to Scripture. And there, where we have the greateſt liberty, I mean in things that relate to the natural World, they have no more indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or moderation, than if it was an intrenchment upon the Articles of Faith.</hi> Let them that are thus incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate in their minds, and immoderate in their ways; anſwer this charge. Prove the Excepter concern'd, and beſides acknowledging his paſt fault, he'll be cautious of recommitting it for the future. But yet the greateſt liberty we have, or may pretend to, in things relating to the natural World; can by no means authorize us to go againſt the letter of Scripture in any caſe, where
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:51858:110"/> it is to be <hi>literally</hi> taken, or may be ſo underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out abſurdity.

                  <hi>In this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular I cannot excuſe the preſent Animadverter; yet I muſt needs ſay, he is a very Saint in compariſon of another Animadverter, who hath written upon the ſame ſubject,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </gap>, <hi>the <hi>preſent</hi> Heavens and the Earth,</hi> ſhall be <hi>kept</hi> and <hi>reſerved <hi>till the day of Iudgment;</hi>
                  </hi> the Doctrine of New Heavens and a new Earth to be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd <hi>before</hi> then, muſt be downright <hi>Contradiction</hi> to this. And truly the ſame it muſt be, to affirm that theſe New Heavens and Earth, ſhall be <hi>conſequent</hi> to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Conflagration.</hi> Nor is there any way to avoid theſe barefac'd Contradictions; unleſs in complaiſance to this pretty Hypotheſis, there muſt be <hi>two</hi> Conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and <hi>two</hi> Days of Judgment, and <hi>two</hi> ends of the World; which is one of each ſort more than GOD has revealed.</p>

               <p>By S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s New heavens therefore and his new Earth, we are to underſtand a <hi>new and excellent ſtate of things,</hi> upon which the bleſſed Saints are all to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the conſummation of this preſent World. And as to what the <hi>Review</hi> ſays,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> 
                  <hi>they muſt be <hi>material</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> in the ſame ſenſe and ſignification with the <hi>former</hi> Heavens and Earth:</hi> this does not appear from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's words. The other ſenſe now mention'd, may rather be inferred from them, conſidering the way or uſage of the holy Writers. For with them it is common, in paſſing from one thing to another, to carry a word or Notion uſed juſt before, along with them farther; or to riſe from a Literal, to an Allegorical, or Anagogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal meaning. Such Tranſitions as theſe (to confine our Obſervation to one ſacred Author) occur very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Goſpel of S. <hi>John.</hi> Thus (in the 4th. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) our SAVIOUR diſcourſing with the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman, about drawing <hi>water</hi> out of a <hi>Deep Well;</hi> carries on the matter to Water that he <hi>could give.</hi> To ſuch Water as he that <hi>drinketh of it ſhall never thirſt;</hi> but it <hi>ſhall be in him a <hi>VVell</hi> ſpringing up into everlaſting life.</hi> But tho the <hi>Well</hi> and the <hi>Water <hi>firſt</hi>
                  </hi> mention'd were <hi>Material;</hi> it does not follow from thence: that the <hi>latter</hi> were the <hi>ſame,</hi> or that they <hi>could</hi> be ſuch. So (Chap. 6.) from ſpeaking of <hi>Loaves,</hi> and of <hi>eating bread;</hi> he raiſes his Diſcourſe, to <hi>that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life.</hi> But yet it is never the more <hi>Material</hi> food; becauſe the <hi>firſt</hi> ſpoken of, was of that nature. And (in the ſame Chapter) the <hi>Jews</hi> telling of <hi>Manna,</hi> or <hi>bread from Heaven,</hi> which their Fathers eat; <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life, he that cometh unto me ſhall never hunger.</hi> But this does not make our SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, <hi>real Manna,</hi> nor was it poſſible he ſhould be <hi>Material bread.</hi> Yea, being but in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Temple, he took occaſion from thence, to call his body by that name (Chap. 2.) <hi>Deſtroy this <hi>Temple,</hi> and I will build
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:51858:113"/> it again in three days.</hi> But was his ſacred Body ever the more a <hi>ſtony building?</hi> And when this was the <hi>way</hi> of our Great REDEEMER, what wonder that his chief Apoſtle ſhould imitate him? And that ſpeaking of the old Heavens and Earth kept in ſtore, and reſerved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fire: ſhould, in raiſing his Diſcourſe to a future, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, bleſſed ſtate; ſpeak of it in the terms, and under the notions, of <hi>new Heavens,</hi> and a <hi>new Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>fourthly,</hi> that the Apoſtles words ſhould point at a <hi>triform ſtate</hi> of Heavens and Earth; is very improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from that <hi>change</hi> which he makes in the <hi>Terms</hi> that he uſes. For in the 5th verſe he uſes the words <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> and in the 7th. verſe again, <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> but in the verſe betwixt both, he ſays, the <hi>World that then was.</hi> Now if he meant the ſame thing in all three verſes, why did he not uſe the ſame Words? and ſay, <hi>the Heavens and the Earth that were then.</hi> This fairly intimates, that he intended not the <hi>natural,</hi> but <hi>animate</hi> World; and principally <hi>Mankind,</hi> whom he called, <hi>the old World,</hi> in this Chapter; and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, <hi>the world of the ungodly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that this <hi>threefold ſtate</hi> of Heavens and Earth, ſhould be denoted in theſe words, is not to be thought; becauſe they certify us, that <hi>the World that then was <hi>periſhed.</hi>
                  </hi> Now could that be true of the <hi>natural</hi> World? Yet it muſt be true of <hi>ſome</hi> World becauſe GOD ſays it: and therefore it muſt relate to a World which <hi>could,</hi> and <hi>did</hi> actually <hi>periſh;</hi> which muſt be the <hi>Animal</hi> World. Indeed by this <hi>Periſhing,</hi> the <hi>Review</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands a <hi>change</hi> only in the <hi>conſtitution</hi> and <hi>form</hi> of the Heavens and Earth. But <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> that be a <hi>periſhing?</hi> Suppoſe ones temper or conſtitution be changed from <hi>Phlegmatic</hi> to <hi>Choleric;</hi> is the man therefore <hi>periſhed?</hi> Or ſuppoſe the Shell of an Egg ſhould crack and ſink inward a little; is the Egg therefore <hi>periſhed?</hi> No more
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:51858:113"/> could the <hi>Material</hi> Heavens and Earth <hi>periſh,</hi> by a meer change of their Conſtitution and form: And had but ſuch a change as <hi>that</hi> befallen them; the Apoſtle would certainly have expreſs'd it accordingly, and not have ſaid, <hi>the World that then was <hi>periſhed.</hi>
                  </hi> But ſince he has thus expreſs'd it, the <hi>animate</hi> World muſt be here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, that ſo the Word ſpoken may come up to the thing, and expreſs it in a juſt and true ſenſe.</p>
               <p>But becauſe he ſays, <hi>that the Apoſtle ſpeaks here of the Natural World, particularly in the</hi> 6th <hi>verſe:</hi> and offers <hi>Reaſons to prove that <hi>it</hi> periſhed (Review. p.</hi> 14.) We ſhall lay down the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of theſe Reaſons, and briefly anſwer them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ground theſe Scoffers went upon, was taken from the <hi>permanency</hi> of the natural World in the <hi>ſame ſtate</hi> from the beginning. And therefore if the Apoſtle would take away their Argument, he muſt ſhow that the <hi>natural</hi> World hath been <hi>changed,</hi> or hath <hi>periſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And does he not ſhow them a ſufficient <hi>change</hi> in <hi>nature</hi> at the Deluge; when (as he minds them) the Earth ſtood ſo deep, and the Heavens ſo high in Water, that thereby the animate world periſhed? Only this change was a change in the <hi>condition,</hi> not of the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of the natural World.</p>
               <p>Secondly, theſe Scoffers could not be ignorant that there was a <hi>Deluge,</hi> which deſtroyed Mankind; and therefore it was the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of thoſe old Heavens and Earth and the <hi>change</hi> and <hi>deſtruction</hi> of them at the Deluge, that they were ignorant of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If they were not <hi>ignorant</hi> of the deſtructive <hi>Deluge,</hi> they might have <hi>forgotten</hi> it,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. p.</hi> 137.</note> and therefore the Apoſtle minds them of it. Or elſe they were ignorant or forgetful of the divine <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the Flood;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 134, &amp;c:</note> which he therefore expreſsly tells them was the <hi>Word of GOD.</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:51858:114"/> But as to the pretended <hi>change</hi> or <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the Heavens and Earth, I doubt not but S. <hi>Peter</hi> was as ignorant of them, as any of the Perſons he reprehends.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle's <hi>deſign</hi> is to prove the <hi>Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,</hi> which will be a <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the <hi>natural</hi> World: and therefore he muſt uſe an Argument taken from a <hi>precedent deſtruction</hi> of that World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Deſign</hi> of the Apoſtle is not to oppoſe <hi>reaſon</hi> to <hi>reaſon</hi> ſtrictly, in a juſt <hi>parity</hi> of <hi>Inſtances;</hi> but fairly to infer <hi>one</hi> judicial and calamitous Providence or Diſpenſation from <hi>another.</hi> And GOD having drowned the <hi>old Heavens,</hi> in <hi>ſome meaſure,</hi> as well as the Earth; by the <hi>word of his power</hi> bringing in the <hi>flood</hi> upon the ungodly: he would from hence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, that by the <hi>ſame word,</hi> the <hi>preſent</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth are reſerved unto <hi>fire;</hi> which ſhall then be the inſtrument of perdition to the impious, and the whole living World; as <hi>water</hi> was before. And ſo from <hi>one general deſtruction paſt,</hi> he ſtrenuouſly argues the <hi>certain futurity</hi> of <hi>another to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, unleſs we underſtand here the <hi>natural</hi> World, we make the Apoſtle both <hi>redundant</hi> in his Diſcourſe, and alſo very <hi>obſcure</hi> in an eaſy Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> His Diſcourſe, for this, will <hi>not</hi> be <hi>redundant,</hi> but very cloſe to his purpoſe. For that is not only to mind theſe Scoffers, that men and other Animals were deſtroyed in a Deluge cauſed by GOD's Power; but to repreſent the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of that Deluge, which ſwell'd ſo <hi>mightily</hi> upon the Earth, that in ſome meaſure it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded</hi> the Heavens. And therefore to what he ſaid of the flood's deſtroying Mankind, in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, v. 5th; he adding here a <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>vaſtneſs</hi> of that Flood, in the drowned poſture which the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and Earth then ſtood in; what he ſays, is far from being <hi>ſuperfluous</hi> or <hi>redundant.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:51858:114"/>
               <p>Nor is his Argument thus made <hi>obſcure.</hi> On the contrary rather it receives light from hence. For he here bringing in the Heavens and Earth into his account of the <hi>Deluge;</hi> does thereby make the <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> of it, he was repreſenting the more conſpicuous.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the <hi>oppoſition</hi> carries it upon the <hi>Natural</hi> World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Heavens and Earth that were of <hi>old,</hi> and the Heavens and Earth that are <hi>now,</hi> we grant are <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</hi> But then 'tis as to their <hi>Fate,</hi> not in their <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi> And tho the Heavens and Earth that are <hi>now,</hi> ſhall <hi>periſh</hi> more <hi>throughly</hi> than they did of <hi>old; Fire</hi> being more conſuming than <hi>Water:</hi> yet then for a time they <hi>periſhed</hi> too. That is, in S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſenſe; with whoſe Authority the <hi>Review</hi> makes ſo loud a noiſe to little purpoſe. For ſo far as I can find, neither he, nor any of the Fathers, who affirm the <hi>Aereal</hi> Heavens pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſht; do think that they periſht any otherwiſe, than by the Water's <hi>riſing up</hi> into the loweſt <hi>Regions</hi> of the Air. And that place of <hi>Bede</hi> which the <hi>Review</hi> cites, ſeems to ſpeak the <hi>common</hi> ſenſe, as well as his <hi>own:</hi> which gives us to underſtand that the Heavens periſhed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> 
                  <hi>cunctis aeris hujus turbulenti ſpatiis, aquarum accreſcentium alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudine conſumptis: All the ſpaces of this turbulent Air, being taken up by the heighth of the ſwelling waters.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, the Heavens periſhed, juſt as the Air does in a Veſſel, when it fills with Water. But let out the Water, and the Air immediately returns into it. So the loweſt Heavens that periſhed at the Flood, by ſtanding in the Water; when that was dried up, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently recovered their firſt Aereal Conſtitution again.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> reaſon is anſwered in the 4th of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exceptions. And from what has been here ſaid, Anſwers may with eaſe be made, to thoſe <hi>Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which the Review alledges, in proof of a <hi>Diverſity</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:51858:115"/> or <hi>Oppoſition</hi> made by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Ancient</hi> Heavens and Earth, and the <hi>Preſent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But farther yet; the Review obſerves, <hi>that S.</hi> Paul <hi>alſo implys that <hi>triple Creation</hi> which S.</hi> Peter <hi>expreſſes.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>p.</hi> 10, 11.</note> For <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.20, 21, <hi>he tells us of a <hi>Creation</hi> that will be <hi>redeemed from vanity:</hi> which are the new Heavens and new Earth to come. <hi>A Creation in ſubjection to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity:</hi> which is the preſent State of uhe World. And a <hi>Creation</hi> that was ſubjected to vanity; in <hi>hopes of being reſtored;</hi> which was the firſt Paradiſiacal Creation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by <hi>Creation</hi> or <hi>Creature</hi> here, to underſtand the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> muſt be <hi>improper.</hi> For firſt, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>the whole Creation,</hi> or <hi>every Creature,</hi> that is here ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 22d. And where does <hi>that</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the <hi>material Heavens and Earth,</hi> in Scripture?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Creature</hi> mention'd, is capable of <hi>waiting,</hi> and of <hi>earneſt expectation,</hi> and of <hi>hope,</hi> and of <hi>pain,</hi> and of <hi>groaning;</hi> as the verſe cited, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, ſhow. Yea, it ſeems to be capable of <hi>groaning</hi> as we our ſelves do, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Which is above the power of <hi>Matter,</hi> tho never ſo ſubtil or celeſtial.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Creature</hi> here, is to be delivered from bondage into glorious liberty, <hi>v.</hi> 21. And this again is a Character which falls not in with the Heavens and Earth. He ſays indeed that <hi>the Creature that will be Redeemed from Vanity, is the <hi>new Heavens and new Earth to come.</hi>
                  </hi> But how will they, (ſuppoſing them come into the <hi>Paradiſiacal</hi> State) be delivered from vanity? For even <hi>then</hi> they can be in no <hi>better</hi> condition, than the <hi>firſt</hi> Paradiſiacal Heavens and Earth were, (as coming but into a ſtate of <hi>Renovation</hi> or <hi>Reſtitution.</hi>) And <hi>they</hi> were ſo far from being <hi>freed</hi> from <hi>Vanity,</hi> that they were ſubject to <hi>corruption,</hi> and <hi>periſhed</hi> at the Deluge, as the Theoriſt holds. And truly ſo muſt the <hi>laſt</hi> Paradiſiacal ones too, unleſs it be prevented.
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:51858:115"/> The new Earth, if it ſtands long enough, muſt be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved</hi> and loſe its <hi>Form:</hi> and the new Heavens muſt be <hi>changed,</hi> at another Deluge, and loſe their <hi>Conſtitution.</hi> Or if the day of Judgment ſhould happen <hi>firſt,</hi> and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this; yet where would be their <hi>Redemption</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance</hi> here phantſied? For ſtill they would be <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>corruptible</hi> in their Nature; as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> were both <hi>Mortal,</hi> tho neither died.</p>
               <p>To which add, that the Theory (<hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 219, 220.) plants <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> in the <hi>New Earth,</hi> and allows them to grow <hi>numerous there, as the ſand by the Sea.</hi> And ſo it can no more be <hi>redeem'd</hi> or <hi>deliver'd</hi> from <hi>Moral</hi> Vanity and Corruption <hi>upon</hi> it; than from <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Vanity and Corruptibility <hi>in</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, This Creature of the Apoſtles is to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>into the glorious liberty of <hi>the Children of God,</hi>
                  </hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 21.</note> now the liberty of GOD's Children is Moral, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Divine, which is not compleated but in the future exalted ſtate of bliſs: Where, being heirs of GOD, and joint heirs with CHRIST, we ſhall be glorified with him, <hi>v.</hi> 17th. But ſuch a liberty as this, is no way compatible to things meerly Phyſical; and ſo the Heavens and Earth, tho never ſo new and paradiſiacal, muſt not pretend to it, cannot partake of it.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that the Theoriſts Interpretation of this Place of Scripture, is not right: and therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity we muſt look out for ſome <hi>other Creature,</hi> as here intended. Nor need we ſearch much to find one. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to <hi>every Creature,</hi>
                  </hi> ſaid the H. JESUS to his Apoſtles, S. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.15. Here the word is the ſame with S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s to the <hi>Romans.</hi> But <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> cannot poſſibly be meant by it, becauſe to <hi>them</hi> there muſt be no Preaching. But by <hi>every Creature,</hi> the <hi>Heathen World</hi> may fitly be underſtood. And ſo this Precept or Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles, is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:51858:116"/> parallel to that in the laſt chapter of S. <hi>Matthew; go, and teach <hi>all</hi> Nations.</hi> And then by the <hi>Vanity</hi> to which the Creature was <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Bondage of Corruption</hi> from which they were to be delivered; we muſt underſtand,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the place.</note> 
                  <hi>Idolatry;</hi> to which the Gentiles were miſerably inſlaved. And <hi>that</hi> indeed, in Scripture, is emphatically expreſt, by <hi>Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Corruption.</hi> So the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15th. having preached to <hi>Idolaters;</hi> declare the end of their Doctrine was to turn them from their VANITIES. And <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> does uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally point at <hi>Idolatry,</hi> by mens CORRUPTING them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And if we frame the Expoſition of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words to this ſenſe; it will run very ſmoothly through the whole Paragraph, without any conſiderable check or Difficulty.</p>

                  </note>But after S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he brings in S. <hi>John</hi> alſo, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance his Phantſie of this <hi>triple State</hi> of Heavens and Earth.

But this City being <hi>Allegorical;</hi> we have no reaſon to think, that the new Heavens, down <hi>from</hi> which; and the new Earth, down <hi>to</hi> which it came, ſhould be otherwiſe. Alſo this Allegation does no more prove <hi>The Triple State</hi> of Heavens and Earth; or that the primitive Earth was <hi>without a Sea:</hi> than it proves there ſhall be a City built of <hi>pure Gold,</hi> whoſe <hi>twelve Gates</hi> ſhall be <hi>twelve Pearls,</hi> (in a <hi>Literal</hi> ſenſe) according to the tenour of that chapter.</p>

               <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is this. In caſe this <hi>Triple ſtate,</hi> or <hi>ſucceſſive Order</hi> of Heavens and Earth, be rightly grounded upon the aforeſaid Apoſtles words; then thoſe <hi>three</hi> moſt eminent Evangelical Writers, muſt implicitly contradict the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And ſo either what he, or what <hi>they</hi> have delivered in <hi>ſome points,</hi> muſt be falſe; and all of them being inſpir'd from above, the H. GHOST muſt contradict Himſelf. By <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine 'tis very plain, that the firſt Earth had an <hi>open Sea.</hi> For GOD, he ſays, gave man <hi>Dominion</hi> over the <hi>Fiſh</hi> of the Sea; and his Dominion over the <hi>Fiſh,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be as full, and withal as ſoon conferr'd upon him, as <hi>that</hi> he had over the <hi>Beaſts</hi> or <hi>Fowls.</hi> And therefore if theſe Apoſtles, warrant this <hi>threefold State</hi> of Heavens and Earth, in the firſt of which there could be no open Sea; their Doctrine muſt neceſſarily claſh with <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, and implicitly contradict it. So again, by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Doctrine, 'tis undeniably plain, that there was <hi>Braſs</hi> and <hi>Iron</hi> in the Praediluvian Earth. For, as he teaches, <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> was an Inſtructer of every Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer in thoſe Metals. And therefore if theſe three famous Apoſtles maintain this triple State of Heavens and Earth; they muſt implicitly interfere with <hi>Moſes</hi> again: becauſe the firſt of theſe ſtates could not poſſibly produce <hi>either</hi> of thoſe Metals; <hi>both</hi> which, according to <hi>Moſes,</hi> were extant in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Exception is this. In caſe ſuch a Triple ſtate as this be truly founded upon the Writings of theſe
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:51858:117"/> 
                  <hi>three</hi> famous men; then as all of them muſt contradict <hi>Moſes</hi> implicitly, ſo one of them muſt contradict himſelf expreſly. I mean S. <hi>John.</hi> For ſpeaking of the ſtate of the <hi>new</hi> Heavens and Earth, he ſays, <hi>there was no more Sea, Apoc.</hi> 21.1. Yet deſcribing the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is to be at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>ſame ſtate;</hi> he ſays, <hi>the Sea gave up the dead which were in it, Apoc.</hi> 20.13. And ſo in ſhort, there is no more probability, that there ſhould be ſuch a <hi>tripple ſtate</hi> as the Theory has invented, built upon theſe Foundations of the Apoſtles laying: than there is poſſibility that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Writers ſhould contradict themſelves, or one another.</p>
               <p>And therefore if what our Author ſays be true; that the <hi>principal parts of this Theory, are ſuch things as are recorded in Scripture;</hi> and ſo <hi>muſt be taken for granted, in one ſenſe or other (Review p.</hi> 1:) yet it is ſo far evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he has not hit upon the <hi>Right</hi> ſenſe of them, as it is evident the ſenſe that he puts upon them, is not conſonant to Scripture. And <hi>that</hi> is ſo evident, that in his interpreting Scriptures, and applying ſeveral of them to his notions;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Review,</hi> p. 8.</note> he ſeems to have veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd his own words, where he ſays, <hi>'tis a kind of fatality upon us to be deceived.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> Yea, even to be deceiv'd in the paſſages of thoſe principal Apoſtles, of which he thus pronounces. <hi>Theſe three places I alledge, as comprehending and confirming the Theory in its full extent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that he ſpeeds no better in dealing with <hi>Prophane</hi> Writers about this Matter; than he did in tampering with <hi>Divine</hi> ones: one Inſtance will evince, which we meet with in his <hi>Review (p.</hi> 20.) where to ſhow the <hi>true importance of</hi>

                  </gap>, meant that the World was <hi>made out</hi> of a thing as out of its <hi>principle.</hi> But did the Theoriſt's firſt Heavens, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in that ſenſe? was water the <hi>Principle</hi> out of which they were made? So far from that, that <hi>they</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly made, and the <hi>Earth</hi> too, without any water in their Compoſition. Yea, the Sun was fain to dart his fiery Beams through the Earth, to rarify the water in the Abyſs below, and from thence to fetch it up by exhalation; before ſo much as <hi>Vapour</hi> could ſpread through thoſe Heavens. So that they were no more <hi>made out</hi> of water, than the Air is made out of Clouds, becauſe they fly in it; or than a County is made out of a River, becauſe it runs through it. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, in <hi>Plato</hi>'s or in <hi>Thales</hi>'s ſenſe, has nothing to do here. For beſides that in the primitive Heavens, there was no formal or ſpecific <hi>Water,</hi> ſave only about the Poles of the Earth where it fell; but only <hi>Vapour:</hi> even that Vapour was but <hi>paſſant</hi> through thoſe Heavens, no <hi>Ingredient</hi> of them; no <hi>Principle</hi> of their Being, or <hi>Part</hi> of their Eſſence. But this was that which, the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher meant, by his, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and the Orator confirms it by his reddition of the Words.</p>
               <p>We cannot conclude, without making this plain, but true Obſervation. <hi>That the Theory of the Earth is a very vain and falſe Hypotheſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Vanity</hi> of it is notorious. For notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:51858:118"/> that it pretends to be <hi>chiefly Philoſophical;</hi> yet all its <hi>Primary Phaenomenaes</hi> that we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and which make up the biggeſt and moſt Philoſophical part of it; are fain to call in the help of <hi>Miracle</hi> to ſupport them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Review, p. <hi>2.</hi>
                  </note>The <hi>firſt,</hi> is <hi>the Original of the Earth from a Chaos.</hi> But that the Formation of this Earth might in due time be effected, it is ſuppoſed to be done by the hand of <hi>Extraordinary</hi> or <hi>miraculous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond,</hi> is <hi>the ſtate of Paradiſe, and the Antediluvian World.</hi> And here <hi>Miracle</hi> muſt come in again: for that World could never have been peopled, had not Angels carry'd Mankind over the Torrid Zone.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third,</hi> is <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Deluge.</hi> But without <hi>Miracle,</hi> no Rains could have been <hi>before</hi> the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of the great Deep were broken up; nor could the falling Ark have been preſerved <hi>after</hi> it.</p>
               <p>Nor is the <hi>Falſeneſs</hi> of the Hypotheſis, inferiour to its <hi>Vanity.</hi> For there is never a one of the Phaenomenaes aforeſaid, but includes too manifeſt <hi>Contradiction</hi> in it, to the ſacred Oracles, or elſe to it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>the Formation of the Earth out of the</hi> Theory's <hi>Chaos, contradicts Scripture.</hi> For <hi>that</hi> tells us the Earth was made the <hi>Third day;</hi> but the Theory ſays it was <hi>increaſed <hi>daily.</hi>
                  </hi> And if to take off this Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>Scripture,</hi> it be alledged that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer allows it might be made in <hi>ſix minutes;</hi> this throws the Contradiction upon the <hi>Theory.</hi> For how could the Earth be made in <hi>ſix minutes,</hi> that was <hi>daily <hi>increaſed?</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:51858:118"/>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>the Paradiſiacal ſtate, and the Antedilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian World</hi> Contradict Scripture. For the <hi>one</hi> gives Paradiſe a Situation <hi>Contrary</hi> to what <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſigns it; and the <hi>other, againſt</hi> his moſt plain Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, excludes both <hi>Metals,</hi> and an <hi>open Sea,</hi> with <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Dominion</hi> over its Fiſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Deluge</hi> contradicts Scripture. For according to the Theoriſt,<note place="margin">See <hi>Diſc. c.</hi> 8. §. 5. <hi>Anſw. p.</hi> 31. <hi>Reply. p.</hi> 67.</note> there were <hi>four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore days</hi> Rain towards making the Flood; but the H. GHOST mentions and allows but <hi>forty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is no more than a Recapitulation, or ſhort Rehearſal of ſome former Remarks. Yet they fully exhibit the nature of the Theory. And when its <hi>Primary</hi> and Eſſential <hi>Phaenomenaes</hi> are ſuch; what muſt its <hi>Secondarys</hi> and <hi>Collaterals</hi> be? If the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent and ſubſtantial parts of an Hypotheſis, be ſo very faulty; impoſſible it is that the Coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents or Appendants of it ſhould be juſtifiable. Yet thus our Author vouches this Hypotheſis, in his <hi>Review (p.</hi> 12.) It <hi>is not only more agreeable to Reaſon and Philoſophy, than any other yet propos'd to the World; but it is alſo more agreeable to Scripture.</hi> Having found out words in Scripture, that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like to his own; he runs directly away with them, and right or wrong applys them to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Juſt as ſome perſons who liſtning unto Bells, think that they ring what runs in their minds; ſo if Scripture phraſes do but chime as it were, or ſound to his ſenſe, our Author concludes that they favour his Notions, tho all be but Phantſy. But let him make good that fair Character, and I am ready to retract what I have ſaid againſt him, and to turn my Exceptions into applauſe. In the mean time, I have purſued the Theory as far as I need.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:51858:119"/> For as for <hi>going through the two laſt Books,</hi> which he ſays <hi>will not be unacceptable to the Theoriſt, (Anſw. p.</hi> 66.) I deem it wholly ſuperfluous. Where the Foundations of an houſe are taken away, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructures can never ſtand. The upper Stories muſt needs follow the fate of the lower ones; and both will certainly fall together.</p>
